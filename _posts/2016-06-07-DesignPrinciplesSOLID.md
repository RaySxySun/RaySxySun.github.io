# Overview

The SOLID principles lie at the heart of the object-oriented programming.

- **Single-responsiblity principle (S, SRP)**
	- a class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

> Classes should change for only a single reason.

- **Open-closed principle (O, OCP)**
	-  you should be able to extend a class's behavior, without modifying it.

> Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.	

- **Liskov substitution principle (L, LSP)**
	- derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

> Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

- **Interface segregation principle (I, ISP)**
	- make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.

> Many specific interfaces are better than a single, general interface.

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (D, DIP)**
	- depend on abstractions not on concrete implementations.

> Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.

- **PLUS: COMPOSITE REUSE PRINCIPLE (CRP)**
