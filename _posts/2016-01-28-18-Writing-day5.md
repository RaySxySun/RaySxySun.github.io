> Reading: Retirement

- In recent years, companies have begun noticing that a large percentage of their employees are not waiting until their sixties to retire. Instead, they are opting for early retirement and are leaving the workforce while they are still in their fifties. After conducting several studies, companies have recognized a couple of reasons for this sudden spate of early retirements by their employment.

- To begin with, many employees who are in their fifties have been working for the same employer and doing the same jobs for many years of even decades. What happens is that they simply become burned out from doing the same tasks over and over again. Furthermore, they discover that their daily routines are no longer challenging but have instead become incredibly boring for them.

- Second of all, many older people compare themselves with their company’s younger employees. When this comparison happens the results are typically not favorable. Older employees are simply unable to maintain the same pace as younger ones; therefore, the older individuals see themselves accomplishing less work than their younger colleagues. In addition, older workers begin to feel as if they are a burden on the company and are not contributing as much as they could. This self-accusing feeling then encourages them to depart their company and take early retirement.

- Now, I’d like to continue talking about how society underutilizes its elderly population. As people live longer and longer, it seems like such a waste for people in their fifties simply to retire and do nothing but play golf or go fishing. So let me give you a couple of suggestions.

- Of course, many elderly people don’t want full-time hobs. However, a large number would be willing to work part-time. This way of working would accomplish a couple of things. First, they wouldn’t have to come in every day. This would keep the elderly from getting too won out to do their jobs. Remember that the elderly have less energy. Also, letting them work part-time would keep their minds fresh, which means that they wouldn’t become bored with their work. Here’s another idea. I know all of you young people think that you know everything, but your experiences are nothing compared to those of a fifty- or sixty-year old person. Companies need to do their best to utilize the skills that their older employees have. For example, they could give them a wider range of duties instead of making them repeat the same tasks over and over. And the companies could consult with their elderly employees more often. This effort would not only make them feel wanted but would also draw upon their many years of experience working at the company. 

> Answer:

- The reading passage mentions a couple of reasons as to why elderly employees are retiring in their fifties before they are required to do so. The professor provides a couple of solutions for the problems that were mentioned in the reading.

- The first problem the reading mentions is that employees often retire after getting burned out and bored from repeatedly doing the same work. So the professor believes companies should allow elderly employees to work part-time, which will preserve their interest in their jobs. Also, working part-time will keep the elderly from being bored at work and will keep their minds fresh.

- Another problem leading to early retirement is that elderly employees compare themselves with younger employees and notice that they do less work and are burdening their companies. Therefore, the professor suggests that companies could give their elderly employees many different tasks to do. Additional, companies could consult elderly employees on a more regular basis and draw upon their many years of experience. By doing so, companies could make their older employees feel as though they are contributing more.

- In conclusion, while the reading passage mentions a couple of important problems, the professor provides two methods that should effectively neutralize these problems and enable the elderly to contribute to their employers while not obligating them to take early retirement.

# **TASK II: Independent Writing**

> Sample 1: What are some important qualities of a good supervisor (boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important. 

- Human beings spend an enormous amount of time at their workplace, and how much they enjoy their workplace depends largely on the attitude and attributes of their supervisor.  I am of the opinion that there are two main characteristics of a good boss, which are his experience and his professionalism.  I will explore these two factors in the following essay.

- First of all, the amount of experience that our boss has is very important, because we are more likely to learn from a supervisor who is very experienced in his field.  Young people who are just starting out in their careers absorb new information like sponges, but even older workers can learn from those who have been around for a long time.  My own experience is a good example of this.  When I began teaching ten years ago, my supervisor, Lars, had been working in education for more than ten years.  I was just out of college and knew very little about creating effective lesson plans, engaging students or even how to complete my paperwork.  Lars took the time to show me what he had learned over previous decade and I was soon able to keep up with my officemates.  In contrast, when I moved to a new school earlier this year, my supervisor actually had less experience teaching than I did.  When I struggled with certain aspects of my job, he had very little to suggest that I did not already know.  As a result, my professional development stagnated.

- Secondly, I feel that the professionalism of a boss is important, as it is essential to the maintenance of a good office environment.  My sister once told me that her first job following her graduation was difficult because of how toxic the office was.  Workers were prone to gossipping, shirking their duties and arriving late each day.  This was seen as acceptable because most of the supervisors in the firm behaved in the exact same way.  My sister was miserable, though, because she prides herself on her diligence and her ability to complete her tasks with care and enthusiasm.  This situation is a stark contrast to my experience with Lars, who I mentioned above.  He arrived early to the office each day, and never engaged in idle gossip about his officemates.  The people he supervised strove to hold themselves to the same standard.

- In conclusion, I believe that experience and professionalism are the hallmarks of a good supervisor.  This is because we can learn a lot from a knowledgeable boss and because employees will strive to emulate a supervisor who acts with professionalism and dignity.

> Sample 2:  We all work or will work in our jobs with many different kinds of people. In your opinion, what are some important characteristics of a co-worker (someone you work closely with)? Use reasons and specific examples to explain why these characteristics are important.

- Everyone in the world spends an enormous amount of time at their workplace, and how much they enjoy their job depends largely on the attitude and attributes of their co-workers.  I am of the opinion that there are two main characteristics of a good co-worker, which are professionalism and a willingness to learn new things.  I will explore these two factors in the following essay.

- First of all, co-workers with a sense of professionalism are desirable because they help to maintain an efficient work environment.  People who behave in a professional manner are less likely to act in a lazy fashion and pass their responsibilities off to others.  In my experience, these things make life much easier for everyone in an organization.  For example, last summer I worked as an intern in a company. the staff at that company were quite overwhelmed by multiple assignments.  It was our busy season, and we had a number of unexpected orders come in from our international clients.  Filling these orders required everyone to focus intently on their areas of responsibility.  While this meant that some employees were working longer hours than others, I greatly appreciated that no one complained about the situation.  Instead, everyone maintained a professional demeanor, and we were able to get through the season.

- Secondly, it is good for workers to feel comfortable learning new things, because in modern society work methods and practices are changing at a rapid pace. The techniques and theories that we might have learned at school even a decade ago are increasingly becoming obsolete.  Workers who are unwilling to learn from their younger colleagues often create unpleasant workplaces.  My own experience is a good example of what I mean.  Last year the firm where I practiced hired a new employee who had more than twenty years of experience in our industry.  While at first glance he seemed like a perfect addition to our organization, his practices were wholly out of step with the modern world.  Not only that, but he became apprehensive and belligerent when younger staff members tried to show him about the current reality of our industry.  Eventually he was dismissed from the firm because of the negative effect he had on his co-workers.
- In conclusion, I believe that professionalism and a willingness to learn new things are the hallmarks of a good employee.  This is because a professional attitude is necessary to ensure a smooth and efficient work environment, and because in today’s rapidly changing world it is always necessary to learn new methods and practices.

> Sample 3: It has recently been announced that a new restaurant may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.

- Whether the residents in a community support or oppose the building of a new restaurant in their neighborhood depends partly on the type of restaurant being proposed. If it’s a fast-food restaurant, there could be some opposition as it’s generally perceived to be not very desirable architecturally and they are usually commonly available within a short drive. If, however, it’s a family-style or specialty restaurant, then there likely would be more interest and enthusiasm. Generally speaking, I would support a new restaurant in the neighborhood.

- The first reason I would support a new restaurant in my neighborhood is for the convenience and choice. It would be nice to have the option of going out to eat within walking distance or within a short drive. Having a restaurant so close to home, I would feel I could make an “on the spur of the moment” decision to go out to eat, with a minimum of time and effort expended. Assuming it’s a family-style or specialty restaurant, it presents something new and different from the existing restaurant would make it a convenient place to meet friends, and for the family to get together.

- Another reason why I would support a new restaurant in the neighborhood is that it would also provide new jobs for the people living in the area and contribute to the existing tax base of the community. Anything that increases jobs and raises the economic activity of a community is good for everyone who lives there, adding to the quality of life and increasing the value of their property.

- In conclusion, a new restaurant in the neighborhood provide both convenience and choice for the residents in the community, giving them a convenient place to meet friends and to get together with family. Additionally, it provides new jobs and new jobs and increases the tax base of the community, adding to the property values.
