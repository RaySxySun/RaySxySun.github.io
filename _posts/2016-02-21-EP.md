# How to improve?

- Start as soon as workers are hired (pre-boarding)

> Trainers should reach out to new workers and provide basic information about the individual's first day.

- Do NOT include too much at once

> Some managers schedule back-to-back training sessions on a new hire's first day. Instead, basic training, form completion and other onboarding should be staggered throughout a candidate's first week or two.

- Extend the process as long as necessary

- Measure the program's effectiveness

> by doing face-to-face survey, HR could get more real opinion of new hires rather than perfunctory & careless feedback
