> Reading: Health

- For the past sixty years, fluoride has been added to the public drinking water in the United States. This measure has greatly improved the health of Americans by enhancing their dental health and bone structure. Thanks to this chemical, the drinking water has been purified and made safer to drink as well.

- The primary reason that fluoride is added to drinking water is to prevent the onset of tooth decay. Fluoride achieves this effect by binding with the enamel on people’s teeth, which helps the teeth remain healthy. Studies conducted over several decades in numerous communities have shown that there has been an average of 12.5 percent less tooth decay and 2.25 fewer teeth lost from decay thanks to fluoride. The Cneter for Disease Control and Prevention also claims that fluoride water treatment can cause a reduction of tooth decay by almost 30 percent.

- Additionally, water treated with fluoride is much purer than untreated water. The reason is that fluoride acts as a cleansing agent. It attacks bacteria and other organisms, essentially removing them from the water. On the basis of this reason alone, the World Health Organization(WHO) has called on many developing nations, where clean drinking water is not always readily available, to increase the fluoride content in their water supplies.

- Some scientists have even pinted out that there is a great deal of evidence that fluoride helps improve the bone structures of people who drink water treated with it every day. Studies have proven that these people’s bone densities have increased, and older women have even shown a tendency to suffer from osteoporosis in smaller numbers if they have drunk fluoride-treated water. And bone fractures from simple falls are less common than in populations of people who do not drink fluoride treated water.

> Transcript:

- Many people have described the benefits of drinking water treated with fluoride. However, this issue is not as cut and dry as people have let you believe. Oh no. It’s actually rather controversial. In fact, many people, myself included, believe that fluoride’s effects can be somewhat detrimental to people.

- The main argument in favor of fluoride has been its tooth-care properties. Countless studies show how much our teeth are being protected by the inserting of fluoride in drinking water. What these studies forget to mention, however, is that practically every brand of toothpaste already has fluoride in it. This means it’s totally unnecessary to put fluoride in drinking water. As a matter of fact, many European countries have abandoned adding fluoride to their drinking water. Some, like Sweden and Netherlands, haven’t done so for over, uh, thirty years, yet they exhibit no decline in dental health.

- While fluoride does purify water, it can still lead to harmful side effects if taken in large amounts since it’s a toxic chemical. It has also been noted for discoloring water pipes and even, get this, dissolving lead, another toxic chemical element, out of the pipes. So it must be carefully monitored if introduced to the water supply. Actually, there are other safer methods of water purification, such as filtration, the adding of chlorine, and using ultraviolet light. 

- And high levels of fluoride may cause cancer in some people. In several cases, it has been deemed responsible for a rare form of bone cancer called osteosarcmas, which usually only appears in young boys. Fluoride also may cause skeletal fluorosis, a condition caused by excessive fluoride exposure where fluoride is deposited directly into bones. This may cause stiffness, pain, and a brittle bone structure prone to fractures.

> Answer:

- The reading passage asserts that adding fluoride to drinking water is highly beneficial, yet the professor feels that the addition of fluoride can actually cause damage to people’s health. 

- While the reading states that studies show fluoride helps to cut down considerably on tooth decay and the loss of teeth, the professor believes these studies forget that people also use toothpaste with fluoride in it. She cites some European examples, where fluoride has not been added to the water for thirty years but people’s dental health is not suffering.

- The reading next mentions that treating water with fluoride helps to purify it. The professor agrees but also says that fluoride can have some dangerous side effects if taken too much and it even dissolves lead out of water pipes. According to the professor, there are safer ways to purify water, including filtration, chlorine treatment, and ultraviolet light.

- Finally, the reading passage claims that people drinking fluoride have stronger bones, suffer from osteoporosis less, and break fewer bones. However, the professor counters by stating that fluoride can cause some rare type of cancer in people. She also adds that it may make some people’s bones stiff, painful, and weak.

# **TASK II: Independent Writing**

> Sample 1: In general, people are living longer now. Discuss the causes of this phenomenon. Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay

- Without a doubt, people are living longer these days than ever before. While there are many explanations for this phenomenon, I believe that the two most important are advances in science and the fact that people today enjoy manageable working lives. I will explore why I feel this way in the following essay.

- First of all, advances in science and technology have done a lot to extend our natural lives. Recently developed pharmaceuticals and medical devices assist doctors in a wide range of ways. They help in the prevention of illness, in the diagnosis of disease, during treatment and even in the provision of follow-up care. For example, several years ago I was diagnosed with skin cancer. Fortunately, my cancer was discovered at a very early stage of the disease and my treatment was provided very quickly and without any unexpected side-effects. My diagnosis was completed very quickly in a modern lab at a high-tech hospital near my home. As a result of this, I made a rapid and complete recovery. In contrast, several decades ago my grandfather passed away as a result of prostate cancer. He was not diagnosed with cancer until just three weeks before his death. This was because there was simply no technology available to make the diagnosis. Last month, however, I read that because of recent scientific advances his form of cancer now has a ninety-percent survival rate.

- Secondly, people today have much more manageable working lives than people in the past experienced. Workers today enjoy both long vacation periods every year and fewer hours at work each day. I, for example, work just thirty-five hours each week and am given five weeks of holiday time each year by my employer. My example is not an outer, as most of my friends and colleagues have a similar benefit package as I do. These perks help me to live a stress-free life and maintain a healthy body. My uncle, who is much older than I, worked more than forty-five hours each week during his career. He enjoyed just a one week holiday each winter. His work was physically demanding and he developed a lot of health problems as he aged. The toll his work took on his body was a major cause of his early death, I believe. The comparison of myself and my uncle demonstrate how today’s working lives contribute to longer life spans.

- In conclusion, I strongly believe that there are two main reasons why people today live longer than earlier generations. Those reasons are advances in science and technology and gentler working conditions.

> Sample 2: In the developed world, average life expectancy is increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.

- It is true that people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems. 

- As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden for working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the fact young adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.

- There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent on vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of older citizens.

- In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.

> Sample 3:  People do many different things to stay healthy. What do you do for good health? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

- Maintaining our health is one of the most effective ways of ensuring that we live a long and happy life.  I do many things in order to stay fit, but the most important maintaining a healthy diet.  There are two reasons why I think this is critically important, which I will explore in the following essay.

- To begin with, eating healthy food prevents obesity, which is the cause of many very serious illnesses.  Obesity is debilitating all by itself, but it also causes patients to suffer from a variety of other illnesses, including diabetes, arthritis and heart disease.  It is important to be aware of this connection when making decisions about the food which we eat.  My eldest cousin is a good example of this.  While my cousin maintained a healthy weight throughout high school and university (despite eating a lot of unhealthy snacks and junk food), when he entered adulthood his metabolism changed and he began to rapidly gain weight.  My cousin is not a particularly self-conscious individual and was never bothered by how his weight gain affected his appearance, so he continued to eat an unhealthy diet.  However, he was eventually diagnosed with adult-onset diabetes which has had a profound effect on his quality of life.  He now regrets not being a bit more careful about his consumption choices.

- Secondly, eating healthy food gives me a lot of energy, which keeps me effective in my personal and professional pursuits.  It is no secret that people who are lacking in certain vitamins and nutrients lack the energy necessary to complete even simple tasks.  I recall how when I was a university student I often skipped meals because I was quite busy studying.  As a result of not eating proper meals, I started to suffer from fatigue and lethargy. My grades began to drop because when it came time to write my tests I could barely keep my eyes open long enough to answer the questions.  Not only that, but my submitted assignments were also quite poor as my fatigue made me unable to keep up with them.  The following year I was a bit more diligent about making healthy food choices and my grades quickly recovered.

- In conclusion, the most important thing I do in order to stay healthy is maintain a nutritious diet.  This is because keeping a healthy diet prevents obesity and related diseases, and because it gives me the energy to keep up with my academic and professional obligations.

> Sample 4: Some people prefer to eat at food stands or restaurants. Other people prefer to prepare and eat food at home. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

- These days, people enjoy a plethora of dining options.  It is now possible to eat food at fine restaurants serving food from around the world, or to use modern technology to prepare great food in the comfort of our own homes.  I prefer to eat at home, rather than going out.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.

- To begin with, home cooked meals are healthier than meals from restaurants, and I strongly value my health.  While meals prepared at restaurants are certainly delicious, they achieve a lot of their flavor from the use of oil, salt and sugar.  Overconsumption of such ingredients can have a profound effect on our health and can even lead to chronic illnesses.  When I cook for myself at home, I precisely measure the amounts of unhealthy ingredients that go into my recipes and try my best to limit them whenever possible.  It is true that my meals may not taste quite as savoury at those I might get at a restaurant, but this does not diminish my enjoyment of the meal.  Rather than enjoying just the taste of the food, much of my pleasure is derived from the enjoyment that went into the cooking of it, and the peace of mind that I gain from knowing that I am taking care of my body.

- Secondly, these days restaurants are increasingly expensive, and this is a major consideration in today’s precarious economic situation.  I do not blame the resturants for this - they must pay a lot for labor, real estate and utilities - but it is true that a meal that might cost five dollars to prepare at home will cost ten times that amount when purchased at a restaurant.  My country also has a tipping culture, which adds increased costs every time I eat out.  For example, I remember last month how I paid about fifteen dollars for a simple meal of fish and chips.  Potatoes are clearly one of the most inexpensive vegetables in the world, and since I live near the sea, fresh fish can be sourced from a local market for just a few dollars a pound.  I enjoyed my meal, but paying that much for it made me feel like I was being irresponsible with my money.

- In conclusion, I certainly prefer to eat at home rather than at a restaurant.  I feel this way because eating at home is healthier, and it makes a lot more economic sense than going out for an expensive meal.
