<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Maps</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Do you ever use maps?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes. Whenever I go <strong>somewhere new</strong>, I plan my journey with <strong>the help of a map</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 When do people usually need to use a map?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I imagine that some people use a map every day if they travel to different places for work. Others might only use a map when they’re on holiday.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Do you prefer electronic or paper maps?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I still prefer paper maps for a long journey; I like being able to <strong>open the map out on</strong> a table and see the full journey <strong>ahead</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 Do you ever ask people for directions instead of using a map?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only if I’m really lost. Whenever I ask for directions, I find it difficult to remember what the person said. So I prefer to find my own way.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Collecting</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Have you ever collected anything as a hobby? (What?)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes. When I was younger I used to collect keyrings. I remember that my favourite was a Lego man keyring that someone bought me as a present.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 What kinds of thing do people often like collecting?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some people collect cheap items like stamps, keyrings or toys. Others collect expensive antiques, watches, jewellery or even cars.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Why do you think people collect certain objects?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maybe they like the constant search for a new item, or they want to remember past experiences. Others might like the feeling of organising and presenting what they own.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 Is there anything that you would like to collect in the future?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes. If I could afford it, I’d love to have a collection of guitars in different colours, shapes and sizes!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Coocking</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Do you like cooking? Why / why not?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sometimes. I like preparing a special meal for family or friends who visit, but everyday cooking is a bit boring; it’s something that has to be done, but it’s not really fun.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Who did the cooking in your family when you were a child?</p>

<ul>
  <li>My mother almost always did the cooking when I was young. I don’t think she trusted my father to make a nice meal.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Do you think that it’s important to know how to cook well?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m not sure whether it’s important to cook well, but I do think that everyone should know the basics. It definitely isn’t healthy to rely on pre-prepared meals or fast food.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 Do you think that children should be taught cookery at school?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, that’s probably a good idea. If all children knew how to cook a few basic, healthy meals, that would surely be a good thing.</li>
</ul>

<p>5 Do you prefer home-cooked food or food from restaurants?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>prefer</strong> home-cooked food because I <strong>think</strong> it<strong>’s</strong> healthier and you <strong>know exactly</strong> what you<strong>‘re eating</strong>. I <strong>also enjoy cooking</strong> for family and friends.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Study</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Do you like studying? Why / why not?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, I like studying because it’s the best way to gain a deeper insight into any subject. I like reading, learning from others, and trying to understand difficult concepts.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Do you prefer to study alone or with others? Why?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I prefer to study alone because I need to be able to concentrate fully. Other people are a distraction.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Where do you prefer to go when you need to study? Why?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I like to find a quiet corner in my local library; being in an old building and surrounded by books seems to help me to focus on my work.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 How do you feel if someone disturbs you when you are studying?</p>

<ul>
  <li>It frustrates me because it breaks my concentration. I prefer to avoid distractions by going somewhere where nobody will interrupt me.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Park</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Do you like parks? Why / why not?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, I <strong>like</strong> parks because they’re great places to <strong>relax</strong> or go for a walk. I think every city <strong>needs</strong> some green space where people can escape from <strong>the crowds</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 How often do you visit parks?</p>

<ul>
  <li>There<strong>’s</strong> a park very close to where I live, so I probably <strong>go</strong> there once or twice a week if the weather’s nice.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Why are parks an important part of many towns and cities?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Parks <strong>are like an oasis</strong> where people <strong>get away from</strong> <strong>the hustle and bustle of</strong> city life. They <strong>are</strong> where people <strong>go to have</strong> lunch, <strong>to take</strong> some exercise, or <strong>to forget</strong> about work for a while.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 What do you think could be done to make parks better?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The parks in big cities <strong>are</strong> already really good in my opinion. If I <strong>think about</strong> the famous parks in London, Paris or New York, I <strong>can’t imagine</strong> what I would do to improve them.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>house/apartment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Do you live in a house or an apartment?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>live</strong> in a semi-detached house with three bedrooms in a suburb of XXX. I<strong>‘ve lived</strong> there for just over a year.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Which is your favourite room in your home? Why?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>don’t really have</strong> a favourite room. But if I <strong>had to choose</strong>, I<strong>‘d say</strong> the living room because that’s where I go to sit and relax.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Would you change anything about your home? Why / why not?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, I<strong>‘ve been meaning to redecorate</strong> it since I <strong>moved in</strong> last year. It <strong>needs</strong> a new kitchen, so that’s what I<strong>‘d change</strong> first.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 Would you like to move to a different home in the future?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, I<strong>‘d definitely move again</strong> at some point if I could <strong>afford to</strong>. I<strong>‘d like to live</strong> in the countryside, or maybe in a different city or country.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Games</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 What games are popular in your country?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Well, if we <strong>can consider</strong> sports as games, then football <strong>is definitely</strong> the most popular game in my country, but we <strong>also love</strong> board games like chess.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Do you play any games?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not regularly these days. I <strong>play</strong> the occasional game of tennis with my brother-in-law, and I <strong>recently played</strong> a bowling game on the Nintendo Wii with my nephew. I <strong>wasn’t</strong> very good at it.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 How do people learn to play games in your country?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>think</strong> children <strong>teach</strong> each other <strong>to play</strong> games. I <strong>remember</strong> a friend at primary school <strong>teaching</strong> me <strong>to play</strong> chess, for example.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 Do you think it’s important for people to play games?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, it<strong>’s</strong> really important, especially for children. I <strong>think</strong> research <strong>has shown</strong> that <strong>play</strong> can <strong>improve</strong> brain development, intelligence, creativity, and the ability <strong>to cooperate with</strong> others.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Reading</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Do you like reading?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, I <strong>like reading</strong> a lot. I <strong>read</strong> all sorts of things, including novels, newspapers, magazines, and online articles.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Do you usually read for leisure or for work purposes?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Well, I <strong>have to do</strong> a certain amount of reading as part of my job, but I <strong>probably read</strong> more for enjoyment. I <strong>pick up</strong> a newspaper most days, and I <strong>usually hav</strong>e a book <strong>on the go</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 What was your favourite book or story when you were a child?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first book that I <strong>remember really enjoying</strong> was ‘……….’. It only <strong>took</strong> me a few days to <strong>read</strong> because I <strong>liked</strong> it so much that I <strong>couldn’t put it down</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 Do you think it’s important that children read regularly?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Definitely. I <strong>think</strong> reading <strong>is possibly</strong> the most important skill that children <strong>learn</strong>. The ability <strong>to read</strong> <strong>opens</strong> the door to all aspects of education.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<blockquote>
  <p>Home Town</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Where are you from?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m from Harbin, which is a city in the north east of China.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Do you like your home town? (Why?)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, I <strong>like living</strong> in Harbin because it<strong>’s</strong> where most of my friends <strong>live</strong>, and because there <strong>are plenty of</strong> things <strong>to do</strong> there. The only thing I <strong>don’t like</strong> is the weather.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Would you prefer to live somewhere else? (Why?)</p>

<ul>
  <li>For the moment I<strong>‘m happy living</strong> here, but at some point I<strong>‘d like to live</strong> in a city with a warmer climate, and I<strong>‘d like to live</strong> near a beach!</li>
</ul>

<p>4 Do you think your home town is a good place for young people? (Why?)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, Harbin <strong>has</strong> lots of things for young people, such as sports facilities, music and cinemas.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Sports</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 What sports or physical activities do you regularly do?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unfortunately I <strong>don’t have</strong> time <strong>to do</strong> any sports or physical activities because of my work commitments. I<strong>‘d like to find</strong> more time for regular exercise.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Which sport or game would you like to be good at?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I<strong>‘d like to be good at</strong> tennis. It <strong>must be great to be able to hit</strong> the ball as hard as you can and <strong>watch</strong> it <strong>land</strong> exactly where you <strong>wanted it to</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Do you prefer watching or playing sports?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>don’t watch</strong> much sport on TV and I<strong>‘m not</strong> a big sports fan, so I <strong>think</strong> I <strong>would probably enjoy doing</strong> sports more than <strong>watching</strong> them.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 Do you think children should be encouraged to do more sport?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, I <strong>think</strong> that sport <strong>is</strong> really important for children. Sports and games <strong>teach</strong> children <strong>to play together</strong> and <strong>try</strong> their best.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>shopping</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Who does most of the shopping in your household?</p>

<ul>
  <li>There <strong>isn’t</strong> one person who <strong>does</strong> most of the shopping. I<strong>‘d say</strong> it<strong>’s</strong> a shared responsibility because we <strong>tend to go shopping</strong> together as a family.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 What kind of shopping do you like doing?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>quite like shopping</strong> for presents for people’s birthdays or for Christmas. My favourite type of shop would <strong>have to be</strong> a bookshop.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Is shopping a popular activity in your country?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, it<strong>’s</strong> very popular. Saturday <strong>is</strong> the busiest shopping day, and lots of people <strong>treat shopping as</strong> a kind of leisure activity, rather than something practical.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 What types of shops do teenagers like best in your country?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I<strong>‘m not</strong> an expert on teenage behaviour, but I <strong>guess</strong> they <strong>like buying</strong> clothes, music, gadgets[ˈgædʒɪt]… that kind of thing.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Toy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Did you play with toys when you were a child?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, of course. I <strong>loved playing</strong> with toys when I <strong>was</strong> a child; I <strong>think</strong> all children <strong>do</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 What kinds of toys did you like?</p>

<ul>
  <li>As far as I <strong>remember</strong>, I <strong>mostly played with</strong> toy cars, planes and action figures from films or cartoons. I <strong>also liked building</strong> things with Lego.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 In your country, do boys and girls play with the same types of toys?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not really. I <strong>think</strong> boys <strong>like</strong> the kinds of toys that I <strong>mentioned</strong> before, whereas girls <strong>play with</strong> dolls. My niece, for example, <strong>doesn’t like</strong> toy cars; she <strong>prefers</strong> dressing dolls in different outfits.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 Do you think that toys help children to learn?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, I <strong>do</strong>. All toys <strong>encourage</strong> children <strong>to use</strong> their imagination and creativity. Even with simple toys, children <strong>imagine</strong> situations and <strong>invent</strong> games and rules.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Telephone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 How often do you make telephone calls?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>probably make</strong> three or four phone calls every day, usually <strong>just to make</strong> arrangements with work colleagues or <strong>to speak to</strong> family and friends.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Who do you spend most time talking to on the telephone?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>think</strong> it <strong>would be</strong> one of my closest work colleagues. We <strong>often call</strong> each other rather than <strong>meeting</strong> face-to-face.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 When do you think you’ll next make a telephone call?</p>

<ul>
  <li>My family <strong>are expecting</strong> me <strong>to phone</strong> them as soon as I <strong>finish</strong> this exam. They<strong>‘ll want to know</strong> how it <strong>went</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 Do you sometimes prefer to send a text message instead of telephoning?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes. I <strong>prefer to send</strong> a text message when I<strong>‘m arranging</strong> something simple, <strong>like</strong> a time <strong>to meet</strong> someone. In those situations, a phone call <strong>isn’t</strong> necessary.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Friends</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Are your friends mostly your age or different ages?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most of my friends <strong>are about</strong> the same age as me because we <strong>met</strong> at school or university. I<strong>‘ve got</strong> one or two friends who are older or younger that I <strong>met through</strong> work.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Do you usually see your friends during the week or at weekends?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>tend to meet up with</strong> my friends at weekends because everyone<strong>’s</strong> too busy during the week.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 The last time you saw your friends, what did you do together?</p>

<ul>
  <li>It <strong>was</strong> one of my friends’ birthday last weekend. Six of us <strong>went out</strong> for a meal <strong>to celebrate</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 In what ways are your friends important to you?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>think</strong> it’s important <strong>to have</strong> friends that you <strong>can talk to and share</strong> experiences with. My friends <strong>make me laugh</strong>, but I <strong>know</strong> I <strong>can also rely on</strong> them whenever I <strong>need</strong> help or support.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Music Instrument</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Which musical instrument do you like listening to most? (Why?)</p>

<ul>
  <li>My favourite musical instrument <strong>to listen to is</strong> the guitar. I <strong>like</strong> the fact that there <strong>are</strong> different types of guitar, like classical, acoustic and electric. I <strong>love</strong> the variety of sounds a guitar <strong>can make</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Have you ever learned to play a musical instrument?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>took</strong> some guitar lessons when I <strong>was</strong> younger and <strong>still have</strong> a guitar at home. I <strong>don’t play</strong> it much nowadays. I <strong>wish</strong> I <strong>had</strong> more time <strong>to practise</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Do you think children should learn to play an instrument at school?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, I <strong>think</strong> it<strong>’s</strong> a great skill and it<strong>’s</strong> really enjoyable <strong>to be able to play</strong> a musical instrument. All children <strong>should be given</strong> this opportunity.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 How easy would it be to learn to play an instrument without a teacher?</p>

<ul>
  <li>It <strong>would probably be</strong> more difficult without a teacher. You <strong>need</strong> someone <strong>to show</strong> you what <strong>to do</strong> and <strong>correct</strong> your mistakes. You <strong>need</strong> a lot of discipline to (OR a lot of self-discipline to) <strong>teach</strong> yourself.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="alert alert-success"> 
    It requires a lot of time, commitment and discipline to keep up with the flow of the course.

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Clothes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Are clothes and clothing fashions important to you? (Why/Why not?)</p>

<ul>
  <li>No, clothes and fashions <strong>are not</strong> really important to me. I <strong>tend to wear</strong> clothes that <strong>are</strong> comfortable and practical rather than fashionable.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 What different clothes do you wear for different situations?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Well, I <strong>have to dress</strong> quite formally for work, so I <strong>wear</strong> a shirt and trousers. At home I <strong>prefer to wear</strong> jeans and a T-shirt, and on special occasions I <strong>might wear</strong> a suit.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Do you wear different styles of clothes now compared to 10 years ago?</p>

<ul>
  <li>No, not really, because I <strong>don’t follow</strong> fashion. I <strong>think</strong> I <strong>have dressed in</strong> a similar way for the last 10 years.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 Do you think the clothes we wear <strong>say(indicate)</strong> something about who we are?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, they <strong>probably do</strong>. Some people <strong>are really careful about</strong> what they <strong>wear</strong> because they <strong>want to be seen</strong> as stylish. Other people <strong>wear</strong> clothes that <strong>show</strong> wealth or status, such as clothes by famous designers.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Communication</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 How do you usually keep in touch with members of your family?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I mostly <strong>keep in touch with</strong> my family by phone, and I<strong>‘ve started using</strong> the Internet <strong>to make</strong> video calls. I also <strong>try to visit</strong> members of my family in person as often as I can.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Do you prefer to speak to people by phone or by writing emails?</p>

<ul>
  <li>It <strong>depends on</strong> the situation. I <strong>use</strong> email and text messages <strong>to communicate with</strong> friends, but my parents <strong>prefer</strong> it if I <strong>phone</strong> them.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Do you ever write letters by hand? (Why / Why not?)</p>

<ul>
  <li>No, I <strong>don’t write</strong> letters by hand because it<strong>’s</strong> so much easier <strong>to send</strong> an email that <strong>will arrive</strong> immediately.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 Is there anything you dislike about mobile phones?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Well, I <strong>don’t like listening to</strong> other people’s conversations in public places, and I <strong>don’t like</strong> it when someone’s phone <strong>rings in</strong> the cinema or during a lesson.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Dancing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Do you like dancing?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>No, I <strong>don’t like dancing</strong>. I<strong>‘m not</strong> a big music fan, and dancing just <strong>makes</strong> me <strong>feel</strong> uncomfortable and self-conscious(除了自觉， 第二个意思).</p>

    <p>self-conscious(除了自觉， 第二个意思)
  excessively and uncomfortably conscious of your appearance or behavior</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2 Has anyone ever taught you to dance?</p>

<ul>
  <li>No, I<strong>‘ve never been interested in learning to dance</strong>, so I<strong>‘ve never taken</strong> any lessons or <strong>asked</strong> anyone <strong>to show</strong> me how <strong>to do</strong> it.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Do you think that traditional dancing will be popular in the future?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I<strong>‘m afraid</strong> I <strong>have no idea</strong> because I <strong>don’t follow</strong> what<strong>’s happening</strong> in the dancing world! I <strong>suppose</strong> it <strong>will always be</strong> popular <strong>with</strong> some people.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>A best friend</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 I <strong>met</strong> my best friend at school when I <strong>was</strong> 11 years old, so we<strong>‘ve known</strong> each other for … years. I <strong>remember</strong> we <strong>sat next to</strong> each other in my first science lesson at secondary school, and we <strong>had to work</strong> together <strong>to do</strong> an experiment. We <strong>got on straight away</strong>, and we<strong>‘ve been</strong> friends ever since.</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
  <p>Work</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Do you work or are you a student?</p>

</ul>

<p>2 Do you enjoy your job?</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>3 What’s the best thing about your job?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The best thing about my job <strong>is</strong> that I <strong>can make</strong> a difference in people’s lives. It<strong>’s a great feeling to see</strong> someone <strong>recover</strong> after an illness because my colleagues and I <strong>were able to help</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 Do you prefer working alone or with others? Why?</p>

<ul>
  <li>In a hospital you <strong>have to work</strong> as part of a team. I<strong>’ve got used to working</strong> with others, and I <strong>think</strong> you <strong>can achieve</strong> a lot more as a team than you <strong>would alone</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Accommodation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Tell me about the kind of accommodation you live in.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>live in</strong> an apartment that <strong>has</strong> a living room, a kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom and a small balcony. It<strong>’s not</strong> a very big, but it<strong>’s just right for</strong> me.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 How long have you lived there?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I<strong>‘ve lived</strong> there for about five years. It<strong>’s</strong> the first apartment that I<strong>‘ve owned</strong>; before that I <strong>was renting</strong> an apartment.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 What do you like about living there?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>like living</strong> there because I <strong>think</strong> the house <strong>reflects</strong> my personality: I <strong>decorated</strong> it myself, I <strong>chose</strong> all the furniture, and everything <strong>is</strong> where I <strong>want it to be</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 What sort of accommodation would you most like to live in?</p>

<p>-If I <strong>could</strong>, I<strong>‘d buy</strong> a bigger house near a beach or in the mountains, preferably somewhere with a warm climate.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>e-mails</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 How often do you send e-mails?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>probably write</strong> between 5 and 10 work emails every day, and I <strong>send emails to</strong> friends or family a few times a week.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Do you prefer to write by hand or on a computer?</p>

<ul>
  <li>It <strong>depends</strong> what I<strong>’m doing</strong>. I <strong>prefer</strong> the computer for most things because it<strong>’s</strong> faster and you <strong>can save</strong> or <strong>copy</strong> things, but I <strong>still like making</strong> notes or <strong>writing</strong> ideas down by hand.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Do you think computers might one day replace handwriting?</p>

<ul>
  <li>No, I <strong>think</strong> we <strong>will always write</strong> by hand as well. I <strong>think</strong> it<strong>’s</strong> an important skill, and schools <strong>will continue to teach</strong> children <strong>to write</strong> by hand before they <strong>learn to type</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>laughing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 What kinds of thing make you laugh?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>laugh most</strong> when I<strong>‘m with</strong> friends <strong>talking about</strong> funny things that <strong>have happened to</strong> us. I <strong>also like watching</strong> comedians and comedy films.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Do you like making other people laugh?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, it<strong>’s</strong> a nice feeling when you <strong>can make</strong> someone laugh because you <strong>can see</strong> that you<strong>‘ve made</strong> them happy. It<strong>’s great to share</strong> a funny moment with someone.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Do you think it’s important for people to laugh?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, of course. It<strong>’s important to see</strong> the funny side of things; humour <strong>helps us not to take</strong> life too seriously. I <strong>think</strong> that laughter <strong>is good for</strong> our health.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 Is laughing the same as feeling happy?</p>

<ul>
  <li>It<strong>’s not</strong> exactly the same because you <strong>can be happy</strong> without laughing, and sometimes we <strong>laugh</strong> when something bad <strong>has happened</strong>; a sense of humour <strong>can help us to cope with</strong> difficult situations.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<blockquote>
  <p>transportation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 What form of transport do you prefer to use? Why?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>prefer to travel by</strong> car because it <strong>means</strong> that I <strong>have</strong> my own space. Also, the buses and trains in my city <strong>are</strong> usually overcrowded; my car <strong>is</strong> much more comfortable.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 How much time do you spend travelling on a normal day?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>probably spend</strong> about an hour and a half <strong>travelling to</strong> and <strong>from</strong> work. I <strong>travel</strong> during the rush hours, so <strong>there is</strong> quite a lot of traffic.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 What do you do while you are travelling?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I usually <strong>listen to</strong> the radio or a CD. In the morning I <strong>like to listen to</strong> the news <strong>to find out</strong> what <strong>is happening</strong> in the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 Do you ever have problems with transport?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, as I <strong>said</strong>, I <strong>get stuck</strong> in <strong>traffic</strong> on my way <strong>to and from</strong> work. I <strong>used to get annoyed</strong> by traffic jams, but now I<strong>‘m used to</strong> them.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>numbers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Do you have a favourite number or a number that is special to you?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, my favourite number is… because it<strong>’s ** the day I ** was born on</strong> , and it** ‘s ** my lucky number.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Do any numbers have special importance in your country?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, certain ages ** are ** special. For example, your 18th birthday ** is ** important because it’s when you ** are considered to become ** an adult.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Are you good at remembering numbers? Why / why not?</p>

<ul>
  <li>No, I** ‘m not ** very good at ** remembering ** numbers. I ** don’t think ** it’s necessary ** to learn ** them by heart; I just ** save ** them on my phone.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 What numbers do people often have to memorise?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The most important number ** to remember ** on a daily basis is the ** pin number ** for your bank card. Without this you ** can’t pay for ** anything or ** get cash out** .</li>

  <p>neighbours</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 How well do you know your next-door neighbours?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>know</strong> my neighbours quite well. They<strong>‘r</strong>e really nice people, and I always <strong>stop to talk</strong> whenever I <strong>see</strong> them. I <strong>think</strong> it<strong>’s important to get on well with</strong> the people who live next door.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 How often do you see them?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>see</strong> my neighbours at least a few times a week. We <strong>usually see</strong> each other when we<strong>‘re leaving for work</strong> in the morning or <strong>coming</strong> home in the evening.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 What problems do people sometimes have with their neighbours?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>think</strong> the most common problem <strong>is</strong> probably noise. It<strong>’s difficult to live</strong> next to people who <strong>have</strong> a dog that barks at night, or who <strong>play</strong> loud music or <strong>have</strong> too many parties.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>mathematics</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 At what age did you start studying mathematics?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>can’t exactly remember</strong>, but it <strong>was probably in</strong> my first year at primary school when I <strong>was</strong> 5 years old. I probably <strong>learnt</strong> simple addition at that age.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Do you like mathematics? Why / why not?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>don’t dislike</strong> maths, but I <strong>wouldn’t say</strong> that I<strong>‘ve ever really liked</strong> the subject either. I<strong>‘m happy to do</strong> simple calculations, but my brain <strong>can’t cope with</strong> the complex stuff!</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Is it necessary for everyone to learn mathematics?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, I <strong>think</strong> it is. We <strong>all need</strong> a basic grounding in maths so that we <strong>can do daily</strong> tasks, like <strong>managing</strong> our money, <strong>working out</strong> bills, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 Do you prefer to use a calculator when doing mathematics?</p>

<ul>
  <li>It <strong>depends</strong>. I <strong>quite like exercising</strong> my brain with anything that<strong>’s easy</strong> enough, but I <strong>use</strong> the calculator on my phone for anything tricky.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Music</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Do you like music?</p>

<ul>
  <li>No, I <strong>don’t really like</strong> music, and I <strong>don’t listen to</strong> it. It<strong>’s</strong> not something that I<strong>‘ve ever been interested in</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 What kind of music did you listen to when you were young?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I c<strong>an’t remember listening to</strong> much music as a child either. I <strong>suppose</strong> I <strong>must have heard</strong> some traditional music at festivals or parties, but I <strong>didn’t take much notice of</strong> it.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 When was the last time you went to a concert?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I<strong>‘ve never been to</strong> a music concert. Maybe I <strong>should try going to</strong> one; perhaps it <strong>would be interesting to see</strong> an orchestra <strong>playing</strong> classical music.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 Would you like to participate in a live music show?</p>

<ul>
  <li>No, definitely not. I <strong>don’t play</strong> a musical instrument and I <strong>don’t sing</strong>, so I <strong>can’t imagine</strong> that I<strong>‘d ever find</strong> myself <strong>performing to</strong> an audience.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>walking</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Do you like walking?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I<strong>‘m not</strong> one for going on really long walks in the countryside, but I <strong>don’t mind walking</strong> when I<strong>‘m</strong> in a town or city, for example when I<strong>‘m sightseeing in</strong> a new place.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Do you think walking is important?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, I <strong>think</strong> it<strong>’s important to be active</strong>, and <strong>walking is</strong> the most basic physical activity that we <strong>can do</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Do you think walking in the countryside is better than walking in the city?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Personally, no. As I <strong>said before</strong>, I <strong>like walking</strong> in the city, especially if it<strong>’s</strong> somewhere with a lot of history like London or Paris.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 What could be done to improve the experience of walking in cities?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>suppose</strong> the main issues <strong>are</strong> space and safety. Pavements <strong>need to be</strong> wide enough <strong>to accommodate</strong> lots of pedestrians, and we <strong>need</strong> safe places <strong>to cross</strong> the street.</li>

</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I’m going to talk about a prize that I would like to win, which is the ‘employee of the year’ award at the company where I work. At the end of December each year, the company directors give this award to a member of staff who has made an outstanding contribution to the business over the previous twelve months.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I first heard about this prize during my training and orientation period just after I got the job three years ago. It was early December and some of my colleagues were discussing who might be awarded ‘employee of the year’ later that month. I was intrigued, and asked them to tell me more about the award.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, the prize is given for ‘outstanding contribution to the business’. We don’t have an exact definition of what this means, but we assume that you have to achieve certain standards, such as 100% attendance, good punctuality, meeting targets and deadlines, good teamwork, and so on. I think the winner also needs to have done something especially creative. For example, last year’s winner created a completely new service for our clients.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’d like to win ‘employee of the year’ because it would mean that my work had been recognised by the company directors, and this would definitely help me to progress in my career. It would also give me a great sense of personal achievement.</p>

  <li>what the game was</li>
  <li>where you played it</li>
  <li>who played this game with you</li>
  <li>and why you liked it</li>
</ul>

<p>1 As a child I <strong>enjoyed playing</strong> chess. I <strong>think</strong> chess <strong>is probably</strong> the best known board game in the world. It<strong>’s</strong> a game for two players, and the aim <strong>is to defeat</strong> the other player by <strong>taking</strong> his or her pieces and eventually <strong>trapping</strong> his King. This final move <strong>is called</strong> checkmate.</p>

<p>2 I <strong>remember</strong> that it <strong>was</strong> a classmate of mine at primary school who first <strong>taught</strong> me <strong>to play</strong> chess. He <strong>had</strong> a small, portable chess set, and once I <strong>knew</strong> how each piece <strong>moved</strong>, we <strong>started playing</strong> at break and lunch times; we <strong>played</strong> in our classroom or outside on the school playground. Later my parents <strong>bought</strong> me my own chess set as a birthday present so that I could <strong>play</strong> at home.</p>

<p>3 I <strong>taught</strong> my younger brother <strong>to play</strong>, and at some point I <strong>joined</strong> the school chess club. There I <strong>had</strong> the chance to <strong>hone</strong> my skills <strong>against</strong> some of the older pupils, and in my final year of primary school I <strong>made it onto</strong> the school team. There <strong>were</strong> five of us <strong>on the team</strong>, and we <strong>competed against</strong> children from other primary schools in the same town.</p>

<p>4 I <strong>liked playing</strong> chess because I <strong>enjoyed</strong> the challenge of <strong>thinking ahead</strong> and <strong>trying to outwit</strong> my opponent. I <strong>was probably</strong> seven or eight years old when I <strong>started playing</strong>, and it seemed like a very mysterious and intellectual game at that time. Also, although I <strong>loved winning</strong>, chess <strong>taught</strong> me <strong>to learn from</strong> my losses and <strong>to congratulate</strong> the person who <strong>had beaten</strong> me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Describe a school that you went to when you were a child. You should say</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the school was</li>
  <li>when you went there</li>
  <li>what the school and the teachers were like</li>
  <li>and explain whether you enjoyed your time there.</li>
</ul>

<p>1 I<strong>’m going to talk</strong> about my primary school. The school <strong>was called</strong> ….. and it <strong>was in</strong> the town of ….. . The location of the school <strong>was</strong> great because it <strong>was within</strong> walking distance of our family home at the time. The route to school <strong>was</strong> all downhill, which <strong>made it</strong> an easy walk in the morning, but a tiring journey on the way home in the afternoon!</p>

<p>2 I <strong>was</strong> a pupil at ….. school between the ages of 5 and 11 - the full 6 years of primary education. From age 11 <strong>onwards</strong>, I <strong>went to</strong> a nearby secondary school.</p>

<p>3 My primary school <strong>seemed like</strong> a big place at the time, but it <strong>was</strong> actually quite a small school, with only six classes. I <strong>remember there being</strong> a large room <strong>called</strong> the assembly hall, where the whole school <strong>gathered</strong> every morning <strong>to hear messages from</strong> the headmaster. I also <strong>remember spending</strong> a lot of time on the playground and on the sports field. I <strong>liked</strong> all of my teachers; they <strong>were caring but strict</strong> at the same time, and I <strong>think</strong> they <strong>fostered</strong> a positive and fun atmosphere in the school.</p>

<p>4 I <strong>have really fond memories of</strong> my primary school years, mainly because of the friends I <strong>made</strong> and the fun I <strong>had</strong>. One of my most vivid memories <strong>is of performing</strong> in the school play in my final year. I <strong>had to learn</strong> lines and <strong>play</strong> the part of a character in a traditional children’s story. It <strong>was</strong> a <strong>nerve-racking</strong> experience, but it <strong>felt like</strong> my first real achievement.</p>

</ul>

<p>1 I<strong>’m going to describe</strong> my sister’s wedding day, which <strong>took place</strong> a few years ago in the town where I <strong>grew up</strong>. For my sister it <strong>was</strong> the biggest and most important day of her life.</p>

<p>2 I <strong>think</strong> there <strong>were</strong> around 100 people at the marriage ceremony, which <strong>was held</strong> in a church. Even more people <strong>came to</strong> the party, or the wedding reception as we <strong>call it</strong>, after the ceremony. Of course, most members of my family <strong>were</strong> there, as well as the groom’s family and <strong>a collection of</strong> the bride and groom’s friends and colleagues.</p>

<p>3 <strong>To make</strong> the celebration special, we <strong>did</strong> what families <strong>normally do</strong>. My mother <strong>made sure that</strong> the church and the <strong>reception venue</strong> <strong>were nicely decorated</strong> - there <strong>were</strong> flowers everywhere! Obviously we <strong>all dressed for</strong> the occasion, and there <strong>were</strong> bridesmaids, gifts, a huge wedding cake, and so on.</p>

<p>4 I <strong>enjoyed</strong> the occasion because it <strong>was great to see</strong> my sister so happy on her big day. The ceremony <strong>was perfect</strong>, and we all <strong>had</strong> a fantastic time at the reception. It<strong>’s rare for me to see</strong> all of my family and friends together in one place, so that<strong>’s probably</strong> what <strong>made</strong> the day so memorable for me.</p>

  <li>what the positive experience was</li>
  <li>where you were</li>
  <li>who you were with</li>
  <li>and explain why you found the experience positive.</li>
</ul>

<p>1 I’m going to <strong>describe</strong> the first time I <strong>visited</strong> one of the biggest city in Australia, Sydney, on a school trip when I <strong>was</strong> a teenager. I <strong>had never been</strong> to Sydney before, and it <strong>was great to share</strong> that experience with my school friends.</p>

<p>2 The positive experience <strong>wasn’t confined to</strong> one particular place in Sydney. As far as I remember, I <strong>enjoyed</strong> the whole trip, from the plane journey to the visits to various tourist attractions. We <strong>got off</strong> the coach near Sydney Harbour Bridge, and so one of my first memories <strong>was seeing</strong> the famous Sydney Opera House. We also <strong>visited</strong> the Sydney Town, Tauranga Zoo and Bondi Beach.</p>

<p>3 As I said earlier, it <strong>was</strong> a school trip, and I <strong>think</strong> there <strong>were</strong> around thirty of us, <strong>including</strong> two teachers. I <strong>was with</strong> a group of close friends, which <strong>made</strong> the experience more enjoyable.</p>

<p>4 What really <strong>struck</strong> me <strong>about</strong> Sydney was that it <strong>was historic but modern and thriving</strong> at the same time. It <strong>seemed to me to be</strong> a lively, fashionable and cosmopolitan place. <strong>Coming from</strong> a relatively small city, the experience <strong>made me keen to visit</strong> more cities around the world in the future.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Describe a subject that you think should be removed from school education programmes. You should say</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>what the subject is</li>
  <li>why you think it is unnecessary for children to study it</li>
  <li>and explain what you would replace it with.</li>
</ul>

<p>1 I’m going to <strong>suggest</strong> that art <strong>could be taken out of</strong> the school curriculum. In my experience, art lessons at school <strong>tend to include</strong> drawing, painting, and the making of collages <strong>using</strong> paper, fabric and other household materials.</p>

<p>2 There <strong>are</strong> a few reasons why I <strong>think that</strong> school art lessons are unnecessary. Firstly, I <strong>don’t believe that</strong> drawing and painting <strong>are essential skills</strong> that children <strong>will need</strong> when they <strong>leave</strong> school. Children <strong>might find</strong> these activities enjoyable, but it<strong>’s unlikely that</strong> they <strong>will need</strong> them in the working world. Secondly, children <strong>can draw, paint and make collages</strong> in their own time at home; parents <strong>can encourage this</strong>, and they <strong>can even join in</strong>. Finally, <strong>remembering</strong> my own art lessons at school, I <strong>don’t think</strong> we <strong>learnt</strong> any real art skills; the teachers <strong>left us to draw or create</strong> things, but they <strong>didn’t provide</strong> much technical instruction.</p>

<p>3 Instead of art lessons, children <strong>could do more work on</strong> core subjects like maths, science or language. These subjects <strong>are more likely to help</strong> children in later life when they <strong>enter</strong> the job market, and I <strong>think</strong> both children and their teachers <strong>would benefit</strong> if more time <strong>were devoted to</strong> them.</p>

</ul>

<p>1 I’m going to <strong>talk about</strong> an interesting conversation that I <strong>had</strong> a couple of weeks ago in a music shop. I <strong>was walking along</strong> one of the main shopping streets in the city centre, when a large window <strong>displaying</strong> all sorts of musical instruments <strong>caught</strong> my eye. Out of curiosity, I <strong>decided to go in</strong> and <strong>have a look around</strong>.</p>

<p>2 The person I <strong>ended up speaking to</strong> <strong>was</strong> a shop assistant on the second floor, in the area of the shop <strong>dedicated to</strong> acoustic guitars. I <strong>hadn’t intended to speak to</strong> anyone, but the assistant <strong>approached me</strong> in a friendly way and <strong>asked whether</strong> I <strong>had</strong> any questions.</p>

<p>3 I <strong>explained to</strong> the assistant that I <strong>hadn’t played</strong> the guitar for years, but that I <strong>wondered what</strong> the differences were between the various acoustic guitars on show. He talked to me about the different makes and models, whether they were factory or hand made, the woods and varnishes used, the variation in sound quality, and of course the price range.</p>

<p>4 I found the conversation fascinating because the shop assistant was so knowledgeable. It was obvious that he had a passion for the guitar, and he didn’t mind talking to me even though I had made it clear that I didn’t intend to buy anything. He even picked up and played three or four of the instruments to demonstrate the differences in their sound.</p>

</ul>

<p>1 I’m going to <strong>talk about</strong> a future plan that I <strong>have</strong>, which <strong>is to buy</strong> a good camera and <strong>to become</strong> a better photographer. At the moment I<strong>’m just using</strong> the camera on my mobile phone, but I<strong>’ve realised</strong> that it <strong>has</strong> its limitations.</p>

<p>2 I <strong>thought of</strong> this plan when I <strong>was</strong> at a friend’s wedding a few weeks ago. I <strong>got</strong> some great pictures of the bride and groom and their guests <strong>celebrating</strong>, but I <strong>did notice</strong> that with my phone camera I <strong>wasn’t able to capture</strong> longer range photos, or photos in darker conditions; the phone’s zoom and flash <strong>aren’t</strong> very good. Next time I<strong>’d like to be able to capture</strong> a special occasion in higher quality images.</p>

<p>3 Obviously this plan <strong>depends on</strong> whether I <strong>can save</strong> enough money <strong>to buy</strong> the camera I<strong>’d like</strong>. Also, before <strong>making a decision about</strong> which camera <strong>to get</strong>, I<strong>’ll probably talk to</strong> a friend who <strong>knows</strong> more about photography than I <strong>do</strong>.</p>

<p>4 In terms of <strong>buying</strong> a camera, I<strong>’ll achieve</strong> this plan if I <strong>can save</strong> some money! In terms of <strong>becoming</strong> a better photographer, I <strong>think</strong> I<strong>’ll achieve</strong> that goal by <strong>experimenting with</strong> my new camera and by <strong>learning</strong> as I <strong>go along</strong>.</p>

  <li>how that season is different from other seasons</li>
  <li>and why it is your favourite season.</li>
</ul>

<p>1 My favourite season in China <strong>is</strong> winter. A typical Northern Chinese winter <strong>would last around</strong> 4 or 5 months between November and March, but when I <strong>say</strong> that I <strong>like</strong> the winter, I<strong>’m really thinking about</strong> the coldest month or two each year.</p>

<p>2 During those really wintry months, the temperature <strong>drops below</strong> zero and it <strong>often snows</strong>. Over the last few years we<strong>’ve had</strong> periods of quite heavy snowfall, to the extent that roads <strong>have been blocked</strong> and schools <strong>have had to close</strong>. Last winter I <strong>remember looking out of</strong> the window one morning and <strong>seeing</strong> everything <strong>covered</strong> in a layer of white.</p>

<p>3 Obviously the snow <strong>is</strong> what <strong>differentiates</strong> winter from the other seasons, but when it <strong>doesn’t snow</strong> there <strong>isn’t</strong> much difference between winter, autumn and spring; winter is just a bit colder.</p>

<p>4 The reason I<strong>’ve chosen</strong> winter as my favourite season <strong>is</strong> because I <strong>like</strong> the snow. I <strong>live near</strong> the countryside, and the landscape <strong>looks</strong> beautiful when everything <strong>is covered</strong> in white. We <strong>also celebrate</strong> Christmas and New Year in the winter, and these <strong>are</strong> my favourite festivals.</p>

  <li>what the market sells</li>
  <li>how big the market is</li>
  <li>and explain why you enjoyed visiting it.</li>
</ul>

<p>1 I’m going to <strong>describe</strong> a street market that I<strong>’ve enjoyed visiting</strong> many times in Dalian. It<strong>’s</strong> the Dalian Central Market, and it <strong>comes to</strong> the city for about a month from the end of March every year. The market stalls <strong>are spread across</strong> several sites in the city centre, but the centrepiece <strong>is</strong> the large market in Zhongshan Square <strong>next to</strong> a university.</p>

<p>2 The Market stalls <strong>sell</strong> an array of souvenir, gifts and mouth-watering food and drink from all over the whole country. It<strong>’s</strong> a great place <strong>to find</strong> handmade crafts such as jewellery, ornaments, wooden toys and other souvenirs, but <strong>it’s</strong> the food and drink that <strong>seem to be</strong> most popular. Probably the biggest seller <strong>is</strong> the ‘xxx’, a hot, sweet wine which is sold in a souvenir mug.</p>

<p>3 The market <strong>was</strong> originally** quite small, <strong>occupying</strong> just one of the squares in Dalian, but it<strong>’s grown quickly</strong> in recent years, <strong>spilling over into</strong> maybe five other pedestrian streets and a few other squares. Apparently there <strong>are</strong> over 200 stalls now, so it’<strong>s become</strong> a really big event <strong>attracting</strong> thousands of visitors.</p>

<p>4 The main reason I<strong>’ve always enjoyed visiting</strong> the Central Market <strong>is</strong> the fantastic atmosphere. When I <strong>went</strong> there last December, it <strong>didn’t matter</strong> how cold or wet the weather <strong>was</strong>, Dalian <strong>seemed to come alive</strong> when the market opened; the streets <strong>were bustling with</strong> people and <strong>there was</strong> a real festive feel to the city.</p>

<p>1 I’m going to <strong>talk</strong> about a funny thing that <strong>happened to</strong> me a couple of weeks ago. I <strong>think</strong> it <strong>was</strong> a Saturday morning, and I <strong>was sitting having</strong> a coffee in a café near where I <strong>live</strong>.</p>

<p>2 I <strong>was</strong> on my own so I <strong>decided to read</strong> the newspaper while <strong>drinking</strong> my coffee. I <strong>must have been</strong> quite <strong>engrossed in</strong> what I <strong>was reading</strong> because the time <strong>passed quickly</strong>, and I <strong>suddenly realised</strong> that I <strong>needed to get going</strong>. What I <strong>didn’t realise</strong> <strong>was</strong> that I <strong>had been sitting</strong> with my legs <strong>crossed</strong>, and one of my legs <strong>had completely gone to sleep</strong>. As I <strong>stood up to leave</strong> the café, I <strong>quickly became aware</strong> that my left leg <strong>was ‘dead’</strong>, but it <strong>was</strong> too late; I <strong>started to fall</strong>. I <strong>thought</strong> I <strong>could catch</strong> myself on the table, but the table <strong>tipped over</strong> and I <strong>fell to</strong> the floor in front of everyone in the café!</p>

<p>3 I <strong>can remember being on my knees</strong> in the middle of the café, <strong>looking up at</strong> the staff and customers around me. I <strong>felt</strong> really embarrassed and I <strong>expected</strong> the other people <strong>to find</strong> it funny, but <strong>to my surprise</strong> nobody <strong>was laughing</strong>. They <strong>were all</strong> worried that something really bad <strong>had happened to</strong> me! As I <strong>got up from</strong> the floor, I <strong>had to explain to</strong> the whole café that I <strong>was</strong> fine. I <strong>was</strong> embarrassed at the time, but I <strong>laughed about</strong> it later!</p>

</ul>

<p>1 I’d like to <strong>talk</strong> about a team project that I <strong>was involved in</strong> during my final term at business school. There <strong>were</strong> four of us on the team, and our task <strong>was to work with</strong> a local company <strong>to research</strong> a new market, in a European country, for one of their products or services. Our objective <strong>was to produce</strong> a report and <strong>give</strong> a presentation.</p>

<p>2 The first thing we <strong>did was split into</strong> two groups of two. We <strong>had been assigned</strong> a company that <strong>produced</strong> a range of bicycle accessories, so two of us <strong>spent</strong> some time <strong>getting to know</strong> the company while the other two <strong>researched</strong> the market and the competitors in the target country, which was Germany. In the end, I <strong>think</strong> it <strong>was</strong> a successful project because we <strong>managed to identify</strong> a possible gap in the market in Germany for one of the company’s products. Our group presentation also <strong>went</strong> really well.</p>

<p>3 Until that point, the course <strong>had been all about</strong> business theory, so it <strong>was</strong> quite a learning experience to <strong>work with</strong> a real company.

  <p>furniture</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 I’m going to <strong>talk</strong> about my favourite chair. It<strong>’s</strong> a big, leather armchair that sits in my <strong>living</strong> room at home, just under my living room window.</p>

<p>2 I <strong>didn’t actually buy</strong> the armchair. One of my friends <strong>was moving</strong> house and <strong>was going to buy</strong> some new furniture. I <strong>had always liked</strong> his leather armchair, so he <strong>said</strong> I <strong>could have</strong> it if I <strong>managed to move</strong> it. The chair <strong>wouldn’t fit in</strong> my car, and it <strong>was tricky to get it out of</strong> my friend’s apartment. I <strong>had to hire</strong> a small <strong>van to take</strong> the armchair home.</p>

<p>3 Obviously I <strong>use</strong> the armchair for <strong>sitting</strong>! It<strong>’s</strong> my favourite place in the house <strong>to relax</strong>, <strong>read</strong> a book, <strong>watch</strong> TV or <strong>even do</strong> some work; the chair’s arms <strong>are</strong> quite wide and flat, so my laptop <strong>fits nicely on</strong> either of them. Last night I <strong>fell asleep in</strong> my armchair while I <strong>was watching</strong> a film.</p>

<p>4 The main reasons why I <strong>like</strong> this piece of furniture <strong>are</strong> that it<strong>’s</strong> comfortable and it<strong>’s</strong> in the perfect position in my living room. The only drawback <strong>might be</strong> that I <strong>enjoy sitting in</strong> the armchair too much, and sometimes I <strong>think</strong> it <strong>makes</strong> me lazy!</p>

  <p>Describe an old building that you like. You should say:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>where it is</li>
  <li>what it is used for</li>
  <li>and why you like it.</li>
</ul>

<p>1 I’m going to <strong>describe</strong> a very famous building in New York: the Empire State Building. People <strong>might not think of it as</strong> an old building, but the Empire State Building <strong>was built</strong> in 1931, so I <strong>don’t think</strong> it <strong>can be classed as</strong> new. It<strong>’s located on</strong> Manhattan island and it<strong>’s probably</strong> the most distinctive and recognisable building when people <strong>look at</strong> New York’s skyline.</p>

<p>2 As far as I know, the Empire State Building <strong>is</strong> an office building, but visitors <strong>can go up to</strong> an observation deck on the <strong>top floor</strong>, which <strong>is</strong> the 102nd floor. There<strong>’s</strong> also a 360-degree observation area on the 86th floor. Apparently, the building <strong>makes</strong> more money from the sale of tickets to the observation floors than it <strong>does</strong> from office rentals.</p>

<p>3 I <strong>think</strong> the Empire State Building <strong>is still</strong> one of the most impressive skyscrapers in the world. It<strong>’s</strong> such an iconic structure, and it<strong>’s</strong> amazing <strong>to think</strong> that it <strong>was built</strong> around 80 years ago. The best thing about the building <strong>is</strong> the viewing deck on the top floor, which <strong>offers</strong> spectacular views of the city; it<strong>’s definitely</strong> <strong>the best vantage point</strong> in New York. many friends <strong>recommend</strong> me <strong>to go there</strong> and <strong>to experience</strong> the view.</p>

  <p>Describe a law in your country.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>1 In many countries it is now illegal to use a mobile phone while driving. You could start by talking about the popularity and benefits of mobile phones, and explain that people want to be able to answer calls wherever they are. Then you could explain the dangers of being distracted while driving; this law could reduce the number of road accidents, and therefore save lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>2 If you feel confident talking about the ‘education’ topic, you could choose the ‘compulsory education’ law. This is the legal requirement that children up to a certain age must attend school. In the UK, for example, children are required by law to continue in education until they are 16 years old. This is a good topic because you can talk about the benefits of education.</p>

  <p>Describe a TV programme or channel that you enjoy watching regularly. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>What it is called  and what is it about?</li>
  <li>When do you usually watch it ?</li>
  <li>Why do you prefer it to other programmes or channels?</li>
</ul>

<p>1 I <strong>rarely watch</strong> traditional television channels nowadays; I <strong>much prefer searching for</strong> interesting programmes or videos online. So, although it<strong>’s</strong> not a normal TV channel or programme, I<strong>’d like to talk about</strong> a website which I think <strong>is</strong> kind of a modern version of a TV channel. It<strong>’s called</strong> TED, which <strong>stands for ‘Technology, Entertainment, Design’</strong>, and it<strong>’s</strong> a great place <strong>to watch</strong> short talks and presentations about all sorts of interesting topics.</p>

<p>2 The good thing about the videos on TED <strong>is</strong> that I <strong>can watch</strong> them whenever I <strong>want</strong>. I <strong>have ted.com saved</strong> as one of my favourites on my laptop, and I <strong>tend to visit</strong> the website every few days <strong>to check</strong> whether there <strong>is</strong> anything new. I <strong>often watch</strong> TED videos on my phone while I<strong>’m travelling to work</strong> on the train.</p>

<p>3 The reason I <strong>like watching</strong> online videos on TED <strong>is</strong> that I <strong>learn</strong> something new every time I <strong>watch</strong> one. The tagline for the TED website <strong>is</strong> ‘ideas worth spreading’, and this <strong>really sums up</strong> the appeal of the site for me. Instead of <strong>watching</strong> meaningless soap operas and talk shows on TV, I<strong>’d much rather spend</strong> 10 minutes <strong>watching</strong> someone <strong>talk about</strong> a breakthrough in technology, science or healthcare.</p>

  <p>Describe a vehicle you would like to buy in the future. You should say</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>what kind of vehicle it is</li>
  <li>what you would use it for</li>
  <li>and why you would like to buy it.</li>
</ul>

<p>1 If I <strong>had</strong> the money, I<strong>’d like to buy</strong> my own helicopter. I <strong>recently saw</strong> a TV programme about someone who <strong>flew around</strong> in his own helicopter, and I <strong>remember thinking</strong> that it <strong>would be great to have</strong> one. The helicopter on the programme <strong>was</strong> a small, blue, two-seater and it <strong>seemed</strong> quite easy <strong>to fly</strong> - that<strong>’s</strong> the kind of thing I<strong>‘d like to buy</strong>.</p>

<p>2 Ideally, I<strong>’d use</strong> my helicopter instead of a car. First, I<strong>’d need to learn to fly</strong> it, but then I<strong>’d use</strong> it to <strong>go on</strong> short trips or holidays. It <strong>would be fantastic to be able to avoid</strong> traffic jams, and <strong>get</strong> everywhere in <strong>a fraction of the time</strong> it <strong>normally takes</strong>. I<strong>’d take</strong> friends and family <strong>sightseeing</strong>, over cities or mountain tops, and maybe I <strong>could even use it to do</strong> the shopping!</p>

<p>3 The reason I<strong>’d like to buy</strong> a helicopter <strong>is</strong> that you <strong>can park</strong> one almost anywhere. You <strong>don’t need to find</strong> a runway or an airport <strong>like</strong> you would for a plane. So I<strong>’d be able to park</strong> my helicopter in my garden - if I <strong>had</strong> a bigger garden. Also, I<strong>’ve always been intrigued</strong> by those helipads on the tops of tall buildings - I <strong>think</strong> it <strong>would be fun to land</strong> on top of a building. A helicopter <strong>probably isn’t</strong> a realistic choice of vehicle, but you <strong>never know</strong> - I <strong>might win</strong> the lottery!</p>

<ul>
  <li>what culture it is and how you know about it</li>
  <li>what differences there are between that culture and your own</li>
  <li>and why you like that foreign culture.</li>
</ul>

<p>1 I’m going to talk about France and French culture. I <strong>know</strong> France quite well because it <strong>was</strong> the first foreign country that I <strong>visited</strong> as a child. I<strong>‘ve been</strong> on a family holidays there, and I <strong>lived and worked</strong> in Paris for a while after <strong>finishing</strong> university.</p>

<p>2 The first thing that <strong>comes to mind</strong> when I <strong>think</strong> about France <strong>is</strong> the bread! I <strong>love</strong> the fact that French people <strong>buy</strong> fresh baguettes every morning, usually from small local bakeries or ‘patisseries’; it <strong>makes</strong> a change from the loaves of sliced bread that most of us <strong>buy from</strong> the supermarket here in the China. One slightly negative difference I <strong>noticed</strong> in Paris <strong>is</strong> that Parisians <strong>don’t seem to make</strong> friends with their work colleagues to the same extent as we do here.</p>

<p>3 I <strong>really like</strong> the café culture in France. You <strong>can always find</strong> somewhere interesting <strong>to sit</strong> and <strong>have a coffee</strong> and <strong>chat to</strong> friends or just <strong>watch</strong> the world** go by<strong>. I **actually put on a bit of weight</strong> when I <strong>lived</strong> in France because I <strong>got into</strong> a habit of <strong>having</strong> a croissant or a cake in every nice café that I <strong>found</strong>. Another thing I <strong>could mention is</strong> that the last time I <strong>went to</strong> France on holiday, I <strong>played</strong> a game called ‘boules’ every day. The game <strong>consists in</strong> throwing metal balls as close to a target ball as possible. It<strong>’s</strong> the perfect game for a relaxing afternoon when the weather’s hot.</p>

</ul>

<p>1 Weibo <strong>is</strong> a social networking website. It<strong>’s</strong> a free website that <strong>gain or share</strong> professional and interesting knowledge,  <strong>find</strong> people you<strong>‘ve lost touch with</strong>, <strong>allows you to keep in contact with</strong> friends. It<strong>’s</strong> one of the most popular websites in the world, with millions of users in my  country.</p>

<p>2 All of my friends <strong>use</strong> Weibo. One of my friends <strong>sent</strong> me an email <strong>inviting me to join</strong>. I <strong>signed up</strong> and I<strong>‘ve been using</strong> it ever since.</p>

<p>3 Wei allows you <strong>to keep up to date with</strong> what people are doing. You <strong>have</strong> a profile page with information and status updates so that you <strong>can tell</strong> everyone what you<strong>‘re doing</strong>. You <strong>can post</strong> articles in your own page, or <strong>send</strong> messages to other people’s pages. You <strong>can also upload</strong> photos and videos. I <strong>find</strong> Weibo most useful for <strong>learning</strong> knowledge , <strong>organising</strong> my life, <strong>keeping in touch with</strong> friends and <strong>storing</strong> photos.

  <p>Garden description</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Today I’d like to describe my uncle’s garden, which I <strong>think</strong> <strong>is</strong> a beautiful one and which I <strong>like</strong> very much. The garden <strong>is</strong> part of his home’s backyard, and the house <strong>is located in</strong> the suburbs, about a 1-hour drive from the city of Dalian. There <strong>is</strong> a big tree right in the middle of the garden, which <strong>is surrounded by</strong> a hot tub, a small water fountain, several bushes, a section for vegetables, and different kinds of flowers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This garden <strong>was actually</strong> one of the reasons why my uncle <strong>chose to buy</strong> the house because it <strong>had been</strong> beautifully <strong>maintained by</strong> the previous owner’s gardener and landscaper. It<strong>’s been only</strong> 1 year since he <strong>bought</strong> the house and now he <strong>is taking care of</strong> the garden by himself. Even though he <strong>is not</strong> experts in gardening, he <strong>still try his best to plant</strong> things that he <strong>like</strong>, such as roses and tulips[‘tjʊləp], and he even <strong>grow</strong> tomatoes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever family and friends <strong>come to visit</strong> his, he <strong>invites</strong> them <strong>to have</strong> a relaxing time in our hot tub, and <strong>enjoy</strong> the view. So in other words, his garden <strong>has also become</strong> a kind of resort! It <strong>definitely requires</strong> lots of hard work <strong>to properly maintain</strong> the garden, but it <strong>gives</strong> him a great sense of accomplishment <strong>to “decorate”</strong> it the way he <strong>like</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All in all, the garden <strong>is</strong> one of the best features of his home and it <strong>is</strong> a place where he <strong>can relax</strong> after a long day of work or during the weekends.</p>

  <li>how you felt</li>
</ul>

<p>1 A recent situation that <strong>made</strong> me angry <strong>was getting stuck</strong> in <strong>a</strong> traffic jam on the way <strong>to meet</strong> some friends. It <strong>was</strong> last Sunday lunchtime, and I <strong>didn’t expect</strong> there <strong>to be</strong> much traffic; people <strong>don’t work</strong> on Sundays, so the roads <strong>aren’t</strong> usually very busy.</p>

<p>2 Everything <strong>was going well</strong> until suddenly I <strong>saw</strong> a queue of cars on the road in front of me. I <strong>had no choice</strong> but <strong>to join</strong> the queue and <strong>wait to get past</strong> whatever <strong>was causing</strong> the delay. It <strong>turned out</strong> that it <strong>was caused by</strong> some roadworks, and it <strong>took</strong> me an extra 30 minutes <strong>to get past</strong> them.</p>

<p>3 <strong>Getting stuck</strong> in traffic congestion <strong>doesn’t</strong> usually <strong>make me angry</strong>, but this time it <strong>did</strong>, mainly because I <strong>wasn’t expecting</strong> it and I <strong>knew</strong> that my friends <strong>were waiting to meet</strong> me for lunch. I <strong>felt frustrated</strong> and powerless because <strong>there was</strong> nothing I <strong>could do to change</strong> the situation, and I <strong>had no idea</strong> how long I <strong>would be sitting</strong> there waiting. When I finally <strong>saw</strong> the reason for the congestion, I <strong>was relieved</strong> that I <strong>was close to getting past</strong> the roadworks, but I <strong>still felt</strong> a bit <strong>stressed knowing</strong> that I <strong>was</strong> half an hour late.</p>

<p>2 He ** became ** successful after many years of ** writing songs ** and ** performing live ** in small venues all over the country.

<p>3 I ** found ** this lesson interesting because my science teacher, Dr. Smith, always ** introduced ** new topics by ** showing ** us a video.

<p>1 I’m going to describe a modern building in [where]. It<strong>’s called</strong> the [name] Tower, and it<strong>’s</strong> the tallest building in the city, with about 50 floors.</p>

<p>2 Although it<strong>’s called</strong> the [nem] Tower, most people <strong>know</strong> this building as the Hilton Hotel. In fact, the bottom half of the tower <strong>is</strong> the hotel and the top half <strong>is</strong> apartments. The apartments <strong>are</strong> expensive because the location and views <strong>make</strong> them very desirable.</p>

<p>3 I<strong>‘m not sure</strong> if I <strong>like</strong> the design of the building, it<strong>’s</strong> just a huge glass tower, but it definitely <strong>stands out</strong>. It <strong>has become</strong> a famous landmark in the city. You <strong>can see</strong> it as you <strong>approach</strong> [where], and it<strong>’s ** an easy place **to meet</strong> people because it<strong>’s</strong> so distinctive and easy <strong>to find</strong>. The most interesting thing about the Tower <strong>is</strong> that <strong>there is</strong> a bar/restaurant on the 23rd floor which <strong>has</strong> spectacular views of the city; it<strong>’s</strong> definitely the best vantage point in [where] because <strong>there are</strong> no walls, only huge windows, so you <strong>can look out over</strong> the city in any direction. I<strong>‘d recommend</strong> anyone who <strong>visits [where] to go</strong> there and <strong>experience</strong> the view.</p>

</ul>

<p>1 I’m going to talk about driving, which <strong>is</strong> a practical skill that I <strong>use</strong> almost every day.</p>

<p>2 I <strong>learnt to drive</strong> a car by <strong>taking</strong> lessons when I <strong>was</strong> 17. My parents <strong>paid for me to have</strong> lessons with a professional driving instructor. I <strong>learnt</strong> by <strong>practising</strong>: first I <strong>had to get used to steering</strong>, <strong>changing gears</strong> and <strong>using</strong> the mirrors, then we <strong>practised</strong> things like <strong>reversing</strong> and <strong>parking</strong>. I <strong>also had to learn</strong> the highway code.</p>

<p>3 As a 17-year-old, I <strong>wanted to have the experience of</strong> driving a car, and I <strong>was fed up with having to walk</strong> or <strong>take</strong> the bus or train whenever I <strong>wanted to go</strong> somewhere. I <strong>also knew</strong> that driving would <strong>be</strong> an extremely useful skill.</p>

<p>4 Being able to drive <strong>has helped</strong> me in so many ways. The public transport where I <strong>live</strong> <strong>isn’t</strong> very good, so I <strong>travel to work</strong> by car most days. Having a car makes my life much easier when it <strong>comes to</strong> things like <strong>shopping</strong> or <strong>visiting</strong> family and friends. (Last week, for example,…)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Describe a festival: Christmas</p>

<p>1 Christmas <strong>is</strong> an annual holiday that, in Christianity, commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>2 Popular customs of the holiday <strong>include</strong> gift-giving, music, an exchange of greeting cards, church celebrations, a special meal, and the display of various decorations; <strong>including</strong> Christmas trees, lights, nativity scenes, and holly. In addition, <strong>Father Christmas</strong> (known as Santa Claus in some areas) <strong>is</strong> a popular figure in many countries, <strong>associated with</strong> the <strong>bringing</strong> of gifts for children.</p>

<p>3 Over the Christmas period, people <strong>decorate</strong> their homes and <strong>exchange</strong> gifts. In some countries, children <strong>perform</strong> plays re-telling the events of the Nativity, or sing carols that reference the event. Christmas, along with Easter, is the period of highest annual church attendance.</p>

<p>4 A special Christmas family meal <strong>is</strong> an important part of the celebration for many, and what <strong>is served</strong> varies greatly from country to country. In England and countries <strong>influenced by</strong> its traditions, a standard Christmas meal <strong>includes</strong> turkey, potatoes, vegetables, sausages and gravy, <strong>followed by</strong> Christmas pudding, mince pies and fruit cake.</p>

<p>1 I’m going to talk about an advertisement for Coca-Cola, which <strong>is</strong> one of the biggest brands in the world. I<strong>‘ve seen</strong> Coke <strong>advertised</strong> everywhere, on posters and TV commercials.</p>

<p>2 The advert <strong>shows</strong> a picture of Santa Claus <strong>smiling and holding</strong> a bottle of Coke. I <strong>think</strong> the aim <strong>is to target</strong> children and <strong>associate</strong> (link/connect) the brand with Christmas time.</p>

<p>3 The advert <strong>is</strong> interesting because the company <strong>is deliberately trying to influence</strong> and <strong>attract</strong> children. The marketers <strong>are trying to capture</strong> young customers. They <strong>are presenting</strong> the drink as something special, a gift for Christmas. However, Coca-Cola <strong>is not</strong> necessarily a healthy drink for children; it <strong>contains</strong> a lot of sugar. Maybe this kind of advertising <strong>manipulates</strong> children and <strong>encourages</strong> them to pester their parents.</p>

    <p>One special toy that I <strong>remember getting was</strong> a Lego car. It <strong>was</strong> a birthday present from my parents. I <strong>can’t remember</strong> exactly how old I <strong>was</strong>, but I <strong>was probably about</strong> 10 or 11.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The special thing about this car <strong>was</strong> that I <strong>had to build</strong> it myself out of hundreds of pieces of Lego. The pieces <strong>came in</strong> a box <strong>with</strong> a picture of the finished car on the front, and I <strong>had to follow</strong> step-by-step instructions <strong>to put</strong> all the pieces <strong>together</strong> in the correct way.  This <strong>wasn’t</strong> an easy task because the car <strong>even had</strong> an engine, movable seats and gears. It <strong>took</strong> me a day or two to make, and <strong>required</strong> a lot of concentration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the car <strong>was finished</strong> it <strong>looked</strong> great, and I <strong>felt</strong> a sense of accomplishment. I <strong>seem to remember</strong> that I <strong>didn’t play with</strong> the car very much; the fun part <strong>had been</strong> the process of <strong>building</strong> it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>when you went on this walk</li>
  <li>where it took place</li>
</ul>

<p>1 When: I’m going to describe a walk that I <strong>enjoyed</strong> last summer while I <strong>was on</strong> holiday on the south coast of Hainan. It <strong>was</strong> the first week of August, and we <strong>set off on</strong> the walk on the first morning of the holiday just after breakfast, at around 9 o’clock. The walk <strong>took</strong> us the whole morning and <strong>finished</strong> at lunchtime.</p>

<p>2 Where: As I <strong>mentioned</strong>, the walk <strong>took place on</strong> the south coast of Hainan. I <strong>was on</strong> holiday with my family in a place <strong>called</strong> …., and we <strong>were staying in</strong> a rented house. Our aim <strong>was to walk from</strong> the house <strong>to a place called</strong> … beach. First we <strong>had to find</strong> the coast path, and then we <strong>followed</strong> this path for several miles until we <strong>reached</strong> … and <strong>finally descended</strong> the steep steps that <strong>led to</strong> the beach.</p>

  <p>Describe an educational television programme that you liked.
You should say</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>what the programme was about</li>
  <li>when and where you saw it</li>
  <li>how you found out about this programme</li>
  <li>and why you liked it.</li>
</ul>

<p>1 I’m going to talk about one of my favourite educational TV programmes, which <strong>is</strong> a nature documentary called ‘Planet Earth’. There <strong>were</strong> eleven episodes of this programme, and each one <strong>featured</strong> a different habitat on Earth, such as mountains, caves, deserts and jungles. The aim of the ‘Planet Earth’ series <strong>was to take</strong> the viewer <strong>into</strong> those habitats, <strong>using</strong> spectacular footage of interesting animals, plants and landscapes.</p>

<p>2 I first <strong>saw</strong> ‘Planet Earth’ on television when it <strong>was broadcast</strong> by the … several years ago. I think it <strong>was shown</strong> every Sunday evening, which <strong>was</strong> the perfect time <strong>to watch</strong> a fascinating nature programme. Then, a few years a ago, somebody <strong>bought</strong> me the DVD box set of the whole series <strong>as</strong> a Christmas present, and I <strong>watched</strong> the episodes again.</p>

<p>3 I <strong>found out</strong> about this TV programme because it <strong>was advertised repeatedly</strong> in the weeks before it <strong>was first aired</strong>. The TV trailers <strong>were really</strong> eye-catching because they <strong>showed</strong> incredibly beautiful images of nature. I also <strong>recognised</strong> the voice of the narrator of the programme, the well-known naturalist …. It <strong>was</strong> these trailers that <strong>persuaded me to watch</strong> the first episode.</p>

<p>4 What I <strong>liked most about</strong> the ‘Planet Earth’ series <strong>was</strong> its stunning photography and its global scope. For example, in the “Fresh Water” episode, they <strong>showed</strong> us the giant salamander in Japan, crocodiles in the river Nile, and river dolphins in the Amazon. I <strong>was amazed at</strong> how they <strong>had managed to</strong> film such interesting creatures in so many locations. I <strong>enjoyed learning about</strong> strange animal species, and the programme <strong>opened my eyes to</strong> the hidden wonders of our planet</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What: One of my hobbies <strong>is</strong> photography.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When and where: I <strong>take</strong> photos <strong>on</strong> my phone almost every day, and I <strong>have</strong> a proper camera that I <strong>use</strong> on special occasions. If I <strong>see</strong> something interesting or I <strong>want to record</strong> a particular memory, I <strong>take</strong> photos wherever I <strong>am</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why: I <strong>take</strong> photos so that I <strong>have</strong> a record of the things I<strong>’ve seen or done</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Describe opinions and feelings:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>like</strong> photography because it<strong>’s</strong> a creative hobby and it <strong>makes</strong> you notice the world around you. I <strong>love capturing</strong> special moments or unusual or beautiful images, and it<strong>’s</strong> a great feeling <strong>to be able to look back through</strong> my pictures and <strong>relive</strong> different experiences. These memories usually <strong>cheer me up</strong>.</li>

<ol>
  <li>Tell a story related to the topic:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>The last time I <strong>took</strong> photos on a special occasion <strong>was at</strong> my friend’s wedding a few weeks ago. I <strong>got</strong> some great pictures of the bride and groom and their guests <strong>celebrating</strong>. After the wedding I <strong>made an album of</strong> all the best pictures and <strong>sent it to</strong> my friend as a present.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Describe a change that you would like to see in your local area.
You should say</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>what the change would be</li>
  <li>who would be involved in making the change</li>
  <li>how it would be done</li>
  <li>
    <p>and why you would like to see the change happen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The change that I<strong>’d like to see</strong> in my local neighbourhood <strong>is</strong> the pedestrianisation of the main shopping street in the town centre. I<strong>’d like to see</strong> traffic <strong>diverted around</strong> this area in order <strong>to make it</strong> saferand more attractive for visitors and shoppers. Most of the traffic that <strong>clogs up</strong> the main street <strong>is just passing through</strong> the town, but it<strong>’s</strong> the local people who <strong>have to put up with</strong> the congestion, noise and pollution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It<strong>’s</strong> the job of the local council <strong>to make changes</strong> like the one I<strong>’m suggesting</strong>. But before the council <strong>does</strong> anything, <strong>there usually needs to be</strong> some pressure from local people <strong>to bring</strong> a problem <strong>to light</strong>. So, perhaps <strong>we need</strong> a campaign by local residents who <strong>want to see</strong> this change. Then the council <strong>might contract</strong> a town planner or an architect <strong>to come up with</strong> some possible designs for a new road system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I<strong>’m not sure</strong> how exactly the process of creating a pedestrian street <strong>would work</strong>, but I <strong>imagine</strong> that it <strong>would require</strong> detailed planning. Perhaps a bypass <strong>would need to be built</strong> around the town centre first. This would <strong>give</strong> drivers a faster <strong>alternative to driving</strong> through the town, and it <strong>would allow</strong> the main shopping street to <strong>be blocked off</strong> and <strong>pedestrianised</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>I<strong>’d like to see</strong> this change because it <strong>would really improve</strong> the quality of life of residents in the town where I <strong>live</strong>. I <strong>can imagine</strong> the new pedestrian street <strong>having</strong> cafes and restaurants <strong>with</strong> outdoor seating. It <strong>would be</strong> a safer and more pleasant place for families <strong>to go shopping</strong>, and I<strong>’m sure</strong> this <strong>would have</strong> a positive knock-on effect on local shops and businesses.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aims for the future: 
Do you think that it’s better to have clear aims for the future, or is it best to take each day as it comes?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>(Answer) I think it’s best to have a good idea of what you want to do with your life, especially in terms of studies and career. (Why) Having aims allows you to plan what you need to do today and tomorrow in order to achieve longer-term objectives. (Example) For example, if you want to become a doctor, you need to choose the right subjects at school, get the right exam results, and work hard at university. (Opposite) Without a clear aim, it would be impossible to take the necessary steps towards a career in medicine, or any other profession.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<blockquote>
  <p>community</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 What are some of the ways people can help others in the community? Which is the most important?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I think there <strong>are</strong> many ways <strong>to help</strong> others in our local communities. For example, where I <strong>live</strong>, some people <strong>volunteer to run</strong> activity clubs for children, or they <strong>help out</strong> in residential homes for elderly people. Others <strong>give</strong> money, food or clothes to organisations that support people <strong>living</strong> below the poverty line. In my opinion, there <strong>isn’t</strong> a scale of importance when it <strong>comes to helping</strong> others; all forms of help <strong>are</strong> positive.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Why do you think some people like to help other people?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most people <strong>get</strong> a good feeling when they <strong>help</strong> others, and they <strong>understand</strong> that we can all <strong>experience</strong> difficult times in our lives when we might <strong>need</strong> support. For example, we all <strong>grow</strong> old, and we all <strong>run</strong> the risk of <strong>losing</strong> our jobs or <strong>having</strong> a health problem that <strong>affects</strong> our ability to <strong>look after</strong> ourselves. So, I <strong>think</strong> people <strong>help</strong> others because they <strong>empathise with</strong> them.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Some people say that people help others in the community more now than they did in the past. Do you agree or disagree? Why?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>disagree with</strong> that kind of opinion. It<strong>’s</strong> impossible to <strong>generalise about</strong> how much people <strong>help</strong> in their communities from one generation to the next, so I <strong>don’t think</strong> we should <strong>try to judge</strong> or <strong>compare</strong> how <strong>altruistic</strong> people are now or were in the past. There <strong>have always been</strong> those who <strong>help</strong> others and those who <strong>don’t</strong>.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>advice</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Is it better to get advice from a friend or from a family member?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I think it <strong>depends on</strong> the kind of advice that you <strong>need</strong>. Parents and grandparents <strong>probably have</strong> more life experience than a friend, and so you <strong>might get</strong> a wiser or more sensible answer from them. On the other hand, friends <strong>are less likely to become</strong> too worried if you <strong>go to</strong> them <strong>with</strong> a problem. For example, I <strong>probably wouldn’t want to burden</strong> my parents with a financial problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 What would you say are the characteristics of a good adviser?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Well, firstly, a good adviser <strong>should be</strong> a good listener, someone who <strong>takes the time to understand</strong> the situation before <strong>offering</strong> advice. Secondly, an adviser <strong>should try to be</strong> objective, and <strong>avoid judging</strong> the person who <strong>is seeking help(no s)</strong>. Finally, I <strong>think</strong> the best advisers <strong>have the ability to ask</strong> the right questions and <strong>encourage others to find</strong> their own answers.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Should people make their own work and career decisions, or is it a good idea to ask for advice about this?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’d say that it<strong>’s</strong> a mixture of both things. Most of us <strong>talk to</strong> family, friends, teachers or colleagues before we <strong>make</strong> career choices. However, I <strong>believe</strong> that the final decision should <strong>rest with</strong> the individual; we all <strong>need to take</strong> ultimate responsibility for the big life choices that we <strong>make</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Holiday</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Do you think that it’s important for people to go on holiday?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, I <strong>think</strong> we all <strong>need to go on holiday</strong> at least once or twice a year. It <strong>isn’t healthy to work</strong> all year round without <strong>some time off to relax</strong>; we all <strong>need to take</strong> a break and <strong>recharge</strong> our batteries from time to time. Last summer, for example, I <strong>went on</strong> holiday to Hainan for a couple of weeks, and it <strong>was great to leave</strong> all of my usual responsibilities behind me. I <strong>came home feeling</strong> really refreshed and reinvigorated [riːɪn’vɪgəreɪt].</li>
</ul>

<p>2) Why do you think some people prefer not to go abroad on holiday?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>suppose</strong> there <strong>are</strong> different reasons why some people <strong>choose not to go</strong> abroad on holidays. Firstly, it<strong>’s</strong> usually more expensive <strong>to travel abroad</strong> than it <strong>is to stay</strong> at home. A second reason could <strong>be that</strong> some people <strong>find</strong> it stressful <strong>to spend</strong> time in a foreign country where they <strong>don’t speak</strong> the language, or where they <strong>feel</strong> that they can’t easily <strong>integrate with</strong> the locals. Finally, many people <strong>just love</strong> where they <strong>live</strong>, and <strong>don’t feel</strong> the need <strong>to travel</strong> abroad.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Hospitality</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 In your country, how do people treat visitors from abroad?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>think</strong> we <strong>treat</strong> visitors well. Most people in China <strong>are</strong> very open-minded and welcoming, and we <strong>enjoy</strong> the mix of cultures that tourism brings. Most cities, for example, <strong>are really cosmopolitan</strong>, and you <strong>can meet visitors</strong> from every part of the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Do you think hospitality towards visitors is less important than it was in the past?</p>

<ul>
  <li>In my city, maybe it<strong>’s true</strong> that hospitality <strong>is less important</strong> nowadays, but that’s only because we <strong>are so used to seeing</strong> visitors from different countries, so we <strong>treat it as</strong> a normal part of life and nothing too special.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 What are the advantages of staying with a friend compared to staying in a hotel when visiting a foreign country?</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you <strong>stay with</strong> a friend, you <strong>benefit from</strong> someone with local knowledge of the best places <strong>to visit</strong>. You <strong>can also get to know</strong> the character and customs of the local people, and for me, this is one of the most interesting aspects of a visit to another country. On the other hand, if you <strong>stay in</strong> a hotel, you <strong>are forced to discover</strong> the new place on your own, so it<strong>’s more of</strong> an adventure.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 Describe a recent journey.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m going to <strong>talk</strong> about a recent journey to Beijing. It <strong>was</strong> a couple of weekends ago, and I <strong>decided to visit</strong> the capital with some friends. I <strong>had never been</strong> before, so I <strong>wanted to go</strong> there <strong>to do some sightseeing</strong>.  I <strong>don’t have</strong> a car, but my friend <strong>does</strong>, so he <strong>volunteered to drive</strong>. He <strong>had done</strong> the trip a few times before, so he <strong>knew</strong> the way. Maybe it <strong>was</strong> a bad idea <strong>to travel</strong> by car because the traffic between Dalian and Beijing <strong>was</strong> terrible. We <strong>spent</strong> a lot of time <strong>sitting in</strong> traffic jams, which <strong>were</strong> due to roadworks and minor accidents, and it <strong>took us the best part of</strong> an afternoon to get there…</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Newspapers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In your opinion, are newspapers important?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, in my opinion newspapers <strong>are</strong> very important (why?) because they <strong>give</strong> us information about what <strong>is happening</strong> around the world. (why?) They <strong>are</strong> a vital source of knowledge about education, technology, medicine and many other fields. (alternative?) If newspapers <strong>didn’t exist</strong>, I <strong>think</strong> the quality of news coverage <strong>would suffer</strong> because <strong>there would be</strong> fewer professional journalists. (example?) We <strong>would have to rely</strong>, for example, <strong>on</strong> unpaid bloggers who <strong>do not have</strong> the budgets to <strong>carry out</strong> detailed research before they <strong>write</strong> an article.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Seasons &amp; Behave</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you think the seasons still influence people’s behaviour?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, I <strong>do think</strong> the seasons <strong>affect</strong> how we <strong>behave</strong>. (how?) We <strong>still wear</strong> different clothes <strong>depending on</strong> the weather, and clothes shops <strong>change</strong> what they <strong>sell</strong> according to the season. We also <strong>adapt</strong> our habits and daily routines according to the time of year. (example) For example, people in my country <strong>like to eat</strong> outside in their gardens in the summer, but we <strong>can’t do</strong> that during the other seasons. (opposite) On the other hand, I <strong>don’t think</strong> we <strong>notice</strong> the change in seasons when <strong>it comes to</strong> food; the big supermarkets <strong>import</strong> food from around the world, so most people <strong>don’t buy</strong> seasonal fruit and vegetables any more.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Find a job</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you think it’s important to find a job that you love, or is it more important to earn a good salary?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Personally, I<strong>‘d prefer to do</strong> a job that I <strong>really enjoy</strong>; as long as I <strong>earn enough to live</strong> comfortably, the salary <strong>is</strong> less important. However, I <strong>can see</strong> the benefits of <strong>doing</strong> a job that you <strong>don’t like</strong> if it pays well. With a good salary, you <strong>can probably do</strong> more enjoyable things in your free time.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Transport</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 What types of transport are there in your town?</p>

<ul>
  <li>In Harbin I <strong>think</strong> you <strong>can find</strong> every form of transport. You <strong>can drive around</strong> the city by car or <strong>get on</strong> a bus; <strong>there are</strong> even free buses that <strong>take</strong> people between the train stations. Harbin <strong>also has</strong> an underground system, and of course <strong>there are</strong> taxis too.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 How has transport changed since your grandparents were young?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Well, they <strong>didn’t have</strong> cars, trains and planes back then, <strong>let alone take</strong> underground subway. as technology <strong>has moved on</strong>, it <strong>is</strong> easy and convenient for people to travel around cities. However, sometimes the transport system <strong>is not</strong> necessarily better nowadays, people <strong>may travel</strong> a lot more, and I<strong>‘m sure</strong> we <strong>spend</strong> more time <strong>getting stuck</strong> in traffic.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 What types of transport do you think we will use in the future?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I<strong>‘m not</strong> sure, but hopefully we<strong>‘ll have</strong> cars that <strong>drive</strong> themselves and never <strong>crash</strong>. I <strong>think</strong> we<strong>‘ll probably fly</strong> more, and it <strong>might become</strong> normal <strong>to have</strong> your own plane. On the other hand, many cities <strong>are building</strong> more bicycle lanes, so maybe we <strong>will use</strong> cars less for** getting around** towns and cities.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Hobbies</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>Do you think it’s important for people to have hobbies? Why?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, I <strong>think</strong> people <strong>need to have</strong> hobbies because we <strong>all need to do</strong> things we <strong>enjoy in</strong> our spare time. In my case, I <strong>find</strong> that <strong>playing</strong> football once a week with some friends <strong>helps me to relax</strong>,** keep fit** and <strong>forget about</strong> work. I <strong>think</strong> it<strong>’s</strong> the same for everyone.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Can hobbies have any negative effects?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, if you <strong>spend</strong> too much time on your hobby, it can <strong>affect</strong> other parts of your life. I <strong>remember</strong> that one of my friends <strong>spent</strong> most of his time at university <strong>playing</strong> computer games instead of <strong>studying</strong>. In the end, he <strong>failed</strong> most of his exams.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Friends</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 What do you think are the most important qualities for friends to have?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maybe the most important things <strong>are</strong> that friends <strong>need to share</strong> common interests and <strong>be honest with</strong> each other. (why?) Friends <strong>are</strong> people we <strong>spend</strong> a lot of time with, so it definitely <strong>helps</strong> if they <strong>enjoy doing</strong> the same activities or <strong>talking about</strong> the same topics as we <strong>do</strong>, and of course we <strong>need to be able to trust</strong> our friends, so honesty <strong>is</strong> vital for a good friendship. (alternatives / example?) I <strong>think</strong> I <strong>would struggle to become</strong> friends with someone who <strong>didn’t have anything</strong> in common with me, or who <strong>wasn’t</strong> reliable or trustworthy.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 How important do you think it is for a person to spend some time alone?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I<strong>’d say</strong> that it<strong>’s</strong> essential <strong>to spend</strong> a bit of time alone, even if it<strong>’s</strong> just a few minutes a day. (why?) When you <strong>have</strong> a few minutes to yourself, it<strong>’s</strong> a chance <strong>to take stock and reflect</strong> on things. (why?) Most of us <strong>live</strong> such busy lives that our brains <strong>need time to catch up</strong> every now and then. (example / alternatives?) Personally, I <strong>try to have</strong> a bit of “me time” every day; I<strong>’ll go for</strong> a coffee or <strong>find</strong> a quiet place <strong>to sit and read</strong> the newspaper. If I <strong>never had</strong> any time alone, I <strong>think</strong> I<strong>’d go mad</strong>!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Children have their own ideas</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you think that school children should be encouraged to have their own ideas, or is it more important for them to learn what their teachers give them?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>think</strong> that we <strong>should definitely allow</strong> children <strong>to be</strong> creative and <strong>have</strong> their own ideas. (why?) Children <strong>need to develop</strong> the ability <strong>to think</strong> for themselves and <strong>solve</strong> problems (why?) because as adults they <strong>will not always have</strong> somebody <strong>to guide</strong> them or <strong>tell</strong> them what <strong>to do</strong>. (alternatives?) If we <strong>don’t allow</strong> children <strong>to have</strong> their own ideas, they <strong>will be</strong> less successful in the adult world; they <strong>will be</strong> too reliant on others. (example?) A doctor, for example, <strong>might encounter</strong> a situation that he or she <strong>hasn’t been trained</strong> for, but <strong>will still be expected to make</strong> a decision that <strong>could save</strong> someone’s life.</li>

  <li>However, I <strong>suppose that</strong> technology <strong>must have affected</strong> music.

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you think the design of homes will change in the future?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>don’t think</strong> there <strong>will be</strong> much change in terms of what houses <strong>look like</strong> from the outside. In this country, people <strong>still like</strong> traditional brick or stone houses. <strong>Having said that</strong>, the design of apartment blocks <strong>will probably continue to develop</strong>, with more and more experimental or futuristic buildings** made of** glass and metal. I <strong>imagine</strong> that it <strong>will be</strong> the insides of homes that <strong>change the most</strong>; houses <strong>will no doubt be</strong> full of technological devices <strong>to make</strong> our lives easier. Maybe we<strong>‘ll have</strong> things <strong>like</strong> voice-controlled doors, lights and appliances.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>History</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 What do you think we can learn by studying events of the past?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>think</strong> we <strong>can learn</strong> a lot by studying history. Just as individual people <strong>learn from</strong> their mistakes, societies <strong>can learn from</strong> the mistakes made by previous governments or leaders. For example, from what I<strong>‘ve read</strong> in the newspapers, many economists <strong>are looking back to</strong> the time of the Great Depression, around 80 years ago, in order to <strong>understand</strong> the financial crisis that <strong>is currently affecting</strong> many countries around the world. Even if we <strong>don’t always learn from</strong> mistakes, I think it<strong>’s fascinating to study</strong> history because it <strong>gives us an insight into</strong> who we <strong>are</strong> and where we <strong>come from</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 What important events do you think might take place in the future?</p>

<ul>
  <li>It<strong>’s</strong> really difficult <strong>to predict</strong> what <strong>will happen</strong> in the future; most of the big, historic events of the past <strong>would have been</strong> impossible <strong>to foresee</strong>. For example, I <strong>don’t think</strong> that anyone <strong>living</strong> 100 years ago <strong>could have imagined</strong> that people <strong>would one day walk on</strong> the moon! If I <strong>had to guess</strong> what <strong>might happen</strong> in the future, I<strong>‘d like to think</strong> that scientists <strong>will invent</strong> cures for diseases <strong>like</strong> cancer, and we<strong>‘ll all live</strong> longer.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Being polite</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 In your country’s culture, how do you show that you are being polite?</p>

<ul>
  <li>We <strong>really value</strong> politeness and good manners in the China, and there <strong>are</strong> many types of polite behaviour. One of the first things we <strong>learn</strong> as children <strong>is to say</strong> “please” and “thank you”. As adults, I <strong>think</strong> we <strong>are careful not to be</strong> too direct in the language we <strong>use</strong>. For example, we <strong>would never say</strong> “Bring me the bill” in a restaurant because this kind of direct instruction <strong>would sound rude</strong>. It <strong>would be</strong> much more polite <strong>to say</strong> “Could we have the bill, please?”.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Are we less polite with members of our families than with people we don’t know?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>suppose</strong> it<strong>’s normal to be</strong> a bit more relaxed about politeness with family members. Most people <strong>tend to speak</strong> in a more informal way at home; in the China, we s<strong>till say</strong> “please” and “thanks”, but it<strong>’s fine to use</strong> colloquial language and things like nicknames that you <strong>would never use with</strong> someone you <strong>didn’t know</strong>.</li>
</ul>

  <p>Celebrities: comparing past and present</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Are there any differences between the types of people who were seen as celebrities in the past and those who are celebrities nowadays?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, I <strong>think</strong> there <strong>have been</strong> some big changes in the types of people who <strong>become</strong> famous. In the past, before the invention of television, I <strong>suppose</strong> there <strong>were</strong> very few national or international celebrities; maybe kings and queens, military, political and religious leaders <strong>were</strong> the only household names. With the advent of TV and radio, performers such as actors and musicians <strong>became</strong> more well-known. However, we <strong>now seem to have</strong> a completely new breed of celebrity as a result of ‘reality’ television programmes; these <strong>are</strong> people who <strong>don’t really have</strong> any special skills as performers, but who <strong>are famous for just being</strong> themselves.</li>

  <p>Imported items</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Why do you think some people prefer to buy products from their own countries rather than imported items?</p>

<ul>
  <li>(idea) I <strong>suppose</strong> it<strong>’s</strong> because those people <strong>want to support</strong> the economy of the country they <strong>live in</strong>. (explain) If they <strong>buy</strong> something that** was made in** their own country, they <strong>know</strong> that they <strong>are contributing to</strong> the salaries of workers within the same country, (alternative) whereas if they <strong>buy</strong> imported items, a foreign company and its employees <strong>will benefit</strong>. (example) For example, if I <strong>buy</strong> some meat that originates from a local farm rather than a farm in another country, I<strong>’m helping</strong> one of my fellow citizens <strong>to carry on in business</strong>. (another idea) Also, I <strong>think</strong> that trust <strong>is</strong> an issue; people <strong>might feel</strong> that they <strong>can trust</strong> domestically produced items more than imported ones.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 How is life different in cities compared to rural areas?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Firstly, the cost of living in cities <strong>is</strong> much higher. Housing <strong>is</strong> much more expensive in cities <strong>compared to</strong> rural areas; everything costs more. I <strong>think</strong> life in cities <strong>is</strong> more difficult. <strong>There are</strong> more people, so there<strong>’s</strong> more competition for jobs. Life <strong>is</strong> a lot slower in rural areas, everyone <strong>knows</strong> each other and there<strong>’s</strong> a sense of community. I <strong>don’t think</strong> rural areas experience the social problems that you <strong>find</strong> in cities, <strong>like</strong> crime and homelessness.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 How do you think life in big cities could be made easier?</p>

<ul>
  <li>In my opinion cities <strong>need to be</strong> well-planned. Good public transport <strong>can definitely make</strong> life easier because <strong>there are</strong> so many people and it <strong>can be really</strong> stressful <strong>just to move around</strong>. Public areas <strong>like</strong> parks <strong>are also</strong> important because people <strong>need space to relax</strong>, and I <strong>think</strong> cities <strong>should be made into</strong> healthier places <strong>to live and work</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 What do you think cities will be like in 50 years time?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>imagine</strong> cities <strong>will be</strong> less <strong>polluted</strong> because we<strong>‘ll have</strong> electric cars and better public transport. More people <strong>might work from</strong> home so maybe cities <strong>won’t be</strong> so busy. But I <strong>think</strong> there <strong>will probably still be</strong> problems because more and more people <strong>are migrating to</strong> cities. So I<strong>‘m not</strong> so optimistic about issues <strong>like</strong> crime, homelessness and unemployment.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use mobile phone</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>For example, yesterday I <strong>used</strong> my phone <strong>to call</strong> some friends <strong>to arrange</strong> a get-together this weekend. Some of them <strong>didn’t answer</strong>, so I <strong>either left</strong> a message in their voicemail or I <strong>sent</strong> them a text. I <strong>also replied to</strong> a few emails while I <strong>was waiting in</strong> a queue at the bank.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>River, lakes, sea</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 What do you think are the functions of rivers nowadays?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rivers <strong>have</strong> various functions. In the China, they <strong>were probably</strong> more important in the past because they <strong>were used for</strong> the transportation of goods, but I <strong>suppose</strong> this <strong>is still</strong> the case in many parts of the world. Rivers can <strong>be used</strong> as a source of renewable energy in the production of hydro-electric power, and they <strong>are also</strong> a source of fresh water for <strong>drinking and irrigation</strong>. Leisure activities <strong>are</strong> another function: fishing, canoeing [kə’nuː], swimming, bathing… I<strong>‘m sure</strong> there <strong>are</strong> many other things I <strong>haven’t thought of</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 What do you think of boats and ships as forms of transportation?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I<strong>‘m not really</strong> a fan of boats and ships. If I<strong>‘m going</strong> abroad, I <strong>like to get to</strong> my destination quickly, so I <strong>prefer travelling</strong> by plane. Of course, ships <strong>are</strong> vital for the transportation of oil and other heavy cargo.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Why do some people like to live near rivers, lakes or the sea?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Well, the view <strong>is probably</strong> a major factor; most people <strong>like to look out to</strong> sea, or <strong>across</strong> a river or lake. I<strong>‘d much prefer to look out of</strong> my window <strong>onto</strong> a natural landscape than an apartment building in a city. Then <strong>there’s</strong> the lifestyle: if you <strong>live close by</strong> the sea, for example, you <strong>can lie on</strong> the beach, <strong>go for</strong> a swim, or <strong>do water sports</strong> like <strong>surfing or waterskiing</strong>. I <strong>definitely wouldn’t mind living near</strong> a beach at some point in my life!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>competition</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>Why do you think some school teachers use competitions as class activities?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>think</strong> teachers <strong>use</strong> competitions <strong>to motivate</strong> the children in their classes. I<strong>‘m sure</strong> that teachers <strong>try</strong> all kinds of activities <strong>to engage</strong> their pupils, and competitions <strong>might be</strong> one of the best ways <strong>to keep</strong> children interested or <strong>get</strong> them excited. Children <strong>love</strong> winning things.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Is it a good thing to give prizes to children who do well at school? Why?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>It <strong>might be a good idea to encourage</strong> children <strong>to do well</strong> in games or sports, but I <strong>don’t think</strong> we <strong>should give children</strong> prizes for their academic work. Children <strong>need to learn</strong> that the reason <strong>for studying is to learn</strong> useful things that <strong>will help</strong> them in their lives. I <strong>don’t like</strong> the idea of children thinking that they <strong>will only work</strong> hard if <strong>there is</strong> a prize.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Would you say that schools for young children have become more or less competitive since you were that age? Why?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>I<strong>‘d say</strong> that they <strong>have become</strong> more competitive since I <strong>was</strong> young. Children now <strong>have to take</strong> exams from a much younger age, so I <strong>think there is</strong> more of a focus on <strong>doing well</strong> in tests. Parents also <strong>seem to be getting</strong> more competitive; I <strong>think</strong> that many parents <strong>push</strong> their children <strong>to do</strong> extra homework rather than <strong>letting</strong> them <strong>play</strong>  with friends.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>emotions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Do you think it’s good to show your emotions when you’re angry?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>think</strong> it <strong>depends on</strong> the situation and how you show your emotions. I <strong>find</strong> that if I<strong>’m angry with</strong> a friend or someone in my family, it<strong>’s best to tell</strong> them what the problem <strong>is and try to express</strong> how I feel. However, I <strong>don’t think</strong> it <strong>helps to argue with</strong> people when you’re angry; it<strong>’s better to control</strong> the anger and <strong>explain</strong> what’s wrong.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 In your opinion, do women show their emotions more than men?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The stereotypical view <strong>is</strong> that women <strong>are</strong> more emotional, and in my experience <strong>there is</strong> some truth in this; my mother, for example, <strong>tends to show</strong> her feelings much more readily than my father. However, I<strong>’m sure</strong> that <strong>there are exceptions to</strong> the stereotype.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Why do you think men tend to show their emotions less than women?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maybe it’s because of the way we <strong>are brought up</strong>. I think that <strong>boys are</strong> often <strong>taught</strong> from an early age not to cry. Also, boys <strong>are aware</strong> that their friends might <strong>see it as a sign of weakness</strong> if they <strong>show</strong> their feelings. Perhaps girls <strong>are brought up to be</strong> more sensitive to their friends’ feelings.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>lifestyle &amp; tenses</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Do you think people had easier lives 50 years ago?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, maybe life <strong>was</strong> simpler and less stressful 50 years ago. The mobile phone <strong>didn’t exist</strong>, so I <strong>suppose</strong> it <strong>was</strong> easier <strong>to forget about</strong> work at the end of the day because people <strong>couldn’t contact</strong> you so easily.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Do you think life will be more stressful in the future?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, it probably <strong>will be</strong> more stressful. As the world <strong>gets</strong> smaller, employees <strong>will probably have to travel to</strong> different countries more often and <strong>stay in touch with</strong> colleagues and clients all over the world. There <strong>will also be</strong> more competition for jobs and the cost of living <strong>will keep going up</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>gender &amp; conversation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 What are the differences between men’s and women’s conversations?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>think</strong> it <strong>depends on</strong> the people who <strong>are having</strong> the conversation, and it <strong>depends on</strong> the situation, but most people <strong>would say</strong> that men <strong>talk more about</strong> sport or cars, whereas women <strong>talk about</strong> their friends, family and relationships. Women <strong>are supposed to be better at expressing</strong> their feelings, while men <strong>prefer not to talk about</strong> themselves.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 What do you think are the characteristics of a good speaker?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>thinkv</strong> good speakers <strong>are confident</strong> and <strong>passionate about</strong> the subject of their speech. They <strong>need to be</strong> interesting and engaging. I <strong>think</strong> a speaker’s body language <strong>is also</strong> really important. A famous example of a great speaker <strong>is</strong> Barack Obama; he <strong>seems to be</strong> a naturally inspiring speaker, but I<strong>‘m sure</strong> that practice and preparation <strong>are more important than</strong> natural talent.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>leisure &amp; economy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 What is the relationship between leisure and the economy?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Well, people <strong>spend</strong> a lot of money on all sorts of leisure activities nowadays, so I <strong>think</strong> leisure <strong>is</strong> a very important part of the economy of most countries. Leisure <strong>could be</strong> anything that people <strong>do</strong> in their free time, such as <strong>eating out</strong>, <strong>going to</strong> the cinema, <strong>watching</strong> a football match, or <strong>staying</strong> in a hotel. Millions of people <strong>are employed</strong> in these areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 How does the economy benefit from people’s leisure activities?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The leisure industry <strong>makes</strong> a huge contribution to the economy. As I said before, it <strong>keeps</strong> millions of people in employment, and all of these employees <strong>pay</strong> their taxes and <strong>have money to spend</strong> on other goods and services. At the same time, most people <strong>spend</strong> some of their earnings on leisure activities, and this money therefore <strong>goes back into</strong> the economy.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Do men and women enjoy the same type of leisure activities?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes and no. I <strong>think</strong> both men and women <strong>enjoy</strong> things <strong>like eating</strong> in restaurants or <strong>going to</strong> the cinema, but I <strong>‘m sure there are</strong> other activities that <strong>are</strong> more popular with one gender. For example, I <strong>think</strong> more men than women <strong>go to</strong> football matches.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wildlife</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 What effects do you think humans have on wild animals?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Humans ** have**  a huge impact on wild animals. We ** have destroyed**  a lot of natural habitats, and many animals ** are**  in danger of extinction. Tigers and rhinos, for example, ** are**  endangered species because of humans. The pollution and waste that we ** produce**  also ** have**  an effect on animals. In some places there ** are**  no fish in the rivers.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 What measures could we take to protect wildlife?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I think we ** need**  stricter rules to protect natural areas and the wild animals that ** live**  there. For example, we ** should stop cutting down**  trees in the rain forest. National parks ** are**  a good idea because they ** attract**  tourists while protecting wildlife.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Is it the responsibility of schools to teach children about protecting wildlife?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, schools can ** play a big part in educating**  children about this issue. Children ** should learn**  how ** to look after**  the natural environment. I ** think**  schools ** already teach**  children about endangered species and the destruction of rain forests, so hopefully future generations ** will do**  a better job of ** protecting**  wildlife.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sports</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Why do you think sport is important?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I ** think ** sport ** is **  important for different reasons. For me, ** doing ** a sport ** is ** about ** having fun** . When I ** play ** football, for example, I ** forget about ** everything else and just ** enjoy ** myself. Also, doing a sport ** helps ** you ** to keep ** fit and healthy, and it** ‘s ** a good way ** to socialise ** and ** make ** friends.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Do you think famous sportspeople are good role models for children?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I ** think ** that sportspeople ** should be ** good role models. Children ** look up to ** their favourite football players, like David Beckham for example, so I ** think ** that these people ** have ** an enormous responsibility. They should ** try to be ** a good influence, and ** behave ** in the right way.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Do you agree that sports stars earn too much money?</p>

<ul>
  <li>In my opinion, it** ‘s**  fair that the best sportspeople ** earn ** a lot of money. ** Being ** a top sportsperson ** requires ** hours of practice, and ** there are ** millions of sports fans who ** are willing to pay to see ** them ** play** . If we ** don’t want ** sportspeople ** to earn ** so much money, we ** shouldn’t go to watch ** them.</li>

  <p>friendship</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Why do you think friendship is important?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>think</strong> friendship <strong>is important for</strong> all sorts of reasons. (why?) We <strong>need</strong> friends <strong>to share</strong> experiences <strong>with</strong>, <strong>to talk to</strong>, and for support. (example?) In my case, I <strong>like to meet up with</strong> friends at the weekend ** to do ** something enjoyable, like <strong>see</strong> a film or <strong>go out</strong> for dinner. I <strong>like chatting with</strong> my friends about what we<strong>‘ve been doing</strong> during the week, or about what<strong>’s happening</strong> in the world. (alternatives?) Without friends <strong>to talk to</strong>, life <strong>would be</strong> dull and boring; we <strong>would only have</strong> our families <strong>to talk to</strong>.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>lessions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 What do you think makes a good lesson?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I ** think ** a good lesson ** is ** one that ** is ** interesting and engaging. By ** ‘engaging’ ** I ** mean ** that the students ** should feel involved ** in the lesson; they ** should feel ** that they ** are learning ** something new that ** is relevant to ** them. In my opinion, a lot ** depends on ** how the teacher ** delivers ** the content of the lesson in a way that students ** like** . My favourite teacher at university ** used to involve ** the students by ** making ** us teach some of the lessons ourselves.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Do you think it’s better to have a teacher or to teach yourself?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Well, ** there’s ** no substitute for a good teacher. I ** think ** you ** can teach ** yourself, but you ** can learn ** a lot more quickly ** with the guidance of ** a teacher. For example, when ** learning ** a language, you ** really need someone to correct ** your mistakes; you ** can get ** the grammar and vocabulary from books, but books ** can’t tell ** you where you** ‘re going ** wrong.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Do you think the traditional classroom will disappear in the future?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I ** don’t think ** it ** will disappear** , but it ** might become ** less common. I ** think ** more people ** will study independently** , ** using ** different technologies rather than ** sitting in ** a classroom. Maybe students ** will attend ** a lesson just once a week, and ** spend ** the rest of their time following online courses or watching video lessons.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>questionnaires</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 What kinds of organisation regularly conduct questionnaires?</p>

<ul>
  <li>All kinds of organisations and companies use questionnaires <strong>to find out</strong> what people <strong>think about</strong> them. For example, university lecturers <strong>often ask</strong> their students <strong>to answer</strong> questions about their courses. Someone from a Starbucks cafe <strong>stopped</strong> me in the street yesterday <strong>to ask</strong> me about my coffee drinking habits.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Do you think schools should ask children for their opinions about lessons?</p>

<ul>
  <li>On the one hand, it <strong>might be</strong> useful for teachers <strong>to get</strong> feedback from children about how much they <strong>learnt</strong> and how enjoyable they <strong>found</strong> the lessons. However, children <strong>don’t necessarily know</strong> what’s best for them, and it <strong>might do more</strong> harm than good <strong>to allow</strong> them <strong>to give</strong> opinions about their teachers.</li>

  <p>technologies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1.What technology or equipment is used in most workplaces nowadays?</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Advice: give a list of different technologies, then talk about one in detail:
</code></pre>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>In most workplaces people <strong>use</strong> equipment such as computers, phones, printers, fax machines and photocopiers. I <strong>think</strong> the computer <strong>is</strong> probably the most essential piece of equipment because we <strong>rely on</strong> it for almost everything: <strong>communicating</strong> by email, <strong>writing</strong> reports, <strong>organising</strong> data, and <strong>finding</strong> information on the Internet.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Does technology help workers, or does it make their lives more difficult?</p>

    <p>Advice: talk about the positives AND the negatives:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Technology definitely <strong>helps</strong> workers because it <strong>makes</strong> many tasks so much easier. For example, email <strong>is</strong> such a useful tool for communication between employees in different offices, or even in different countries. On the other hand, technology <strong>can make</strong> life more difficult, especially when it <strong>goes wrong</strong>. It <strong>causes</strong> a lot of stress when the Internet <strong>is down</strong> or a <strong>computer crashes</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What effect does new technology have on employment?</p>

    <p>Advice: give the good effects AND the bad effects:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>I think technology <strong>is often responsible for</strong> people <strong>losing</strong> their jobs. Machines <strong>have replaced</strong> people in areas like manufacturing and agriculture, and whenever a new technology <strong>is introduced</strong>, <strong>there are</strong> redundancies. At the same time, jobs <strong>might be created</strong> <strong>thanks to</strong> a new technology; <strong>there would be</strong> no computer programmers if the computer <strong>hadn’t been invented</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 How do you think the Internet will affect our lives in the future?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Personal perspective: I <strong>think</strong> the Internet <strong>has</strong> a huge impact on our lives. More and more people <strong>are using</strong> social websites <strong>to keep in touch with</strong> friends. I <strong>think</strong> the Internet will probably <strong>replace</strong> TV because most channels <em>**</em>are already available online.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Economic perspective: Also, I <strong>think</strong> we<strong>‘ll do</strong> more online shopping. Web-based companies <strong>like</strong> Amazon <strong>are already</strong> really successful. In the future, there will probably <strong>be</strong> more companies that only <strong>sell</strong> via the Internet, and I <strong>expect</strong> we<strong>‘ll spend</strong> more money online than in traditional shops.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Educational perspective: Schools and universities <strong>might also use</strong> the Internet <strong>to provide</strong> courses, so online learning <strong>will probably become</strong> a normal part of life.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>status symbols</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 In your country, what possessions show a higher status or position in society?</p>

<ul>
  <li>In my country, people who <strong>are wealthy tend to buy</strong> big houses and cars. Certain makes of car such as Mercedes or Ferrari <strong>are</strong> status symbols. They <strong>**let other people **know that</strong> you <strong>are important or powerful</strong>. People who <strong>want to give</strong> this impression <strong>often wear</strong> expensive designer clothes, or watches by brands like Rolex.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Do you think we place too much importance on possessions?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Probably, yes. Some people <strong>are obsessed with showing off</strong> their new mobile phone or <strong>wearing</strong> the latest fashions. I <strong>think</strong> it<strong>’s</strong> a problem for teenagers because <strong>there’s</strong> a lot of peer pressure <strong>to follow</strong> fashion or <strong>buy</strong> the latest gadget that their friends <strong>have got</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Do you think things were different 50 years ago?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, maybe people <strong>were</strong> less materialistic. I <strong>think</strong> they <strong>bought</strong> things that <strong>lasted</strong> longer; my grandparents <strong>talk about</strong> how they <strong>repaired</strong> things rather than <strong>throwing</strong> them away. Maybe brands and advertising <strong>weren’t</strong> as powerful as they <strong>are</strong> now.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>children’s toys</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>Do you think it’s important for boys to play with “boys’ toys” and for girls to only play with “girls’ toys”?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>think</strong> boys naturally <strong>seem to prefer playing with</strong> “boys’ toys” and girls with “girls’ toys”. When I <strong>was</strong> young I <strong>had</strong> toy cars, trucks, guns and things like that, whereas my sister <strong>always wanted to play with</strong> dolls. I <strong>don’t suppose</strong> it really <strong>matters</strong> if a boy <strong>plays with</strong> a doll or a girl <strong>plays with</strong> a toy car, but children <strong>learn quickly</strong> what toys <strong>are supposed to be</strong> for boys and for girls.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Do you think it’s good if parents only buy “educational” toys for their children?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>No, I <strong>don’t agree with</strong> only giving children educational toys. In my opinion, children learn by <strong>playing with</strong> whatever <strong>interests</strong> them. Children <strong>invent</strong> their own games, even if they <strong>don’t have</strong> any toys at all. It<strong>’s</strong> important for children just to <strong>have fun</strong>; <strong>there will be</strong> plenty of time for parents <strong>to worry about</strong> education when their children get older.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>disagreements</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>(Idea / basic answer) Teenagers <strong>disagree with</strong> their parents about all sorts of things, like the clothes they <strong>want to wear</strong>, whether they <strong>can go out with</strong> their friends, <strong>doing</strong> homework, and how much <strong>help</strong> they <strong>give</strong> their parents around the house. (Explain why) I <strong>think</strong> the teenage years <strong>are</strong> when we <strong>develop</strong> a sense of identity, and we <strong>want to make</strong> our own decisions rather than <strong>follow</strong> other people’s instructions. (Personal example) I <strong>remember having</strong> disagreements <strong>with</strong> my own parents, usually about simple things <strong>like getting up early</strong> in the morning, <strong>tidying</strong> my room, or <strong>doing</strong> the <strong>washing up</strong>!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>TV</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Do you think most people watch TV for education or for entertainment?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>think</strong> people <strong>watch</strong> TV primarily for entertainment. <strong>There are</strong> far more entertainment programmes than educational ones, and in my experience most people <strong>treat</strong> television <strong>as</strong> a form of relaxation in the evening. If I <strong>think about</strong> the most popular TV programmes in the China, such as talent shows like ‘X Factor’ or soap operas like ‘…’, the focus <strong>is definitely on</strong> entertainment rather than education.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Should TV play a role in educating children? How?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, it <strong>definitely should play a role in</strong> my opinion. Good children’s TV programmes <strong>should tell</strong> stories that <strong>contain</strong> some kind of lesson about how <strong>to behave</strong> or what <strong>is</strong> morally right and wrong. Many of the traditional fairy tales, such as ‘Cinderella’, <strong>have been made into</strong> TV programmes, and there <strong>is always</strong> a postive message in those stories.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 How do you think TV viewing habits change as people get older?</p>

<ul>
  <li>TV viewing habits obviously <strong>change</strong> a lot as we <strong>get older</strong>. While toddlers <strong>might watch</strong> programmes about <strong>talking</strong> animals, teenagers <strong>prefer</strong> action and adventure or sports, and as adults we <strong>start taking</strong> an interest in news and politics. My own preferences, for example, <strong>have changed</strong> over the years - I <strong>would never have watched</strong> news programmes when I <strong>was</strong> younger. I <strong>think</strong> it <strong>would be</strong> very strange if our viewing habits <strong>didn’t mature</strong>!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>films have changed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 Do you think films have changed since you were a child?</p>

<ul>
  <li>No, I <strong>don’t think</strong> films <strong>have changed much</strong> since I <strong>was</strong> a child. When I <strong>was</strong> younger I <strong>enjoyed watching</strong> action films, and the Hollywood formula for this type of film <strong>seems to be</strong> the same today. For example, I <strong>liked</strong> the original ‘Superman’ films, and superheroes <strong>are still</strong> a popular subject for film-makers.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 As the technology for home viewing improves, do you think people will stop going to the cinema in future?</p>

<ul>
  <li>No, I <strong>don’t think</strong> that people <strong>will stop going to</strong> the cinema. People <strong>can already buy</strong> fantastic home viewing equipment, but it <strong>still feels</strong> more special <strong>to share</strong> the experience of <strong>watching</strong> a new film <strong>with</strong> a theatre full of people. I <strong>don’t think</strong> that technology <strong>will be able to replicate</strong> that cinema atmosphere.</li>

Essential preparation

1. Favourites: Don't go into the test without knowing what your favourites are. 
            Prepare to talk about your favourite book, film, music, and website.
            
2. People: Be ready to talk about a famous person and a member of your family.

3. Activities: Have you prepared some ideas about a hobby? 
            Can you describe a typical day in your life? 
            Try to remember some special moments in your life, such as birthdays, festivals and weddings.
            
4. Places: You need to be able to talk about where you live. 
        Also, think about the places you have visited, what you did there, and why you liked or didn't like them.
        
5. Things: Can you talk about the things you use every day, something you would like to buy, 
        or a present that you received?
