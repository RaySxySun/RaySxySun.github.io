    <p>One of the most promising new developments in personal transportation is the smart car. A smart car is one the utilizes advanced methods of engineering or computers with some kinds of artificial intelligence. While smart car have not yet reached their full potential, they are sure to be beneficial to all who eventually drive them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One advantage of smart cars is that they will help traffic flow faster. A smart car will be able to handle many of the driving duties. Thereby allowing the people in the car to attend to other matters. Because the car, for the most part, will be driving itself, it will be able to select optimal routes based on their lack of vehicles and the speed with which they may be traveled upon. This, in turn, will make travel times much shorter and keep traffic moving continuously.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, a smart car will have lower maintenance costs. Since the car will be almost entirely run by computers, the computers will be able to alert the owner when there is a minor problem to be fixed. The owner will then be able to fix the car at a low cost as opposed to waiting for the problem to develop into a major issue that would require an inordinate amount of money to be spent.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Transcript</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Let’s move on to another piece of technology that we are sure to see in the future. I’m talking, of course, about smart cars. Now, don’t get too thrilled about them. Yeah, it would be nice to have smart cars do all the driving for us, but they probably won’t be as breathtaking as everyone anticipates. Here, let me explain for you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To begin with, you’ve all seen movies with scenes of smart cars zipping around through traffic, right? Well, unfortunately, that probably won’t be what will happen. It’s a documented fact that, as automobile technology has improved, the amount of traffic has steadily increased. So while we may have cars do the driving for us, you can expect to sit in longer traffic jams. Just because they’re smart cars doesn’t mean that they’ll be smart enough to get you out of a traffic jam.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second of all, they are not going to be cheap to maintain. “Why?” you may ask. Well, most of the parts of a smart car will be custom-made. This means that, due to the manufacturing process, replacing the parts will be expensive. Sure, the labor bill may be cheap, but the bill for the parts is going to be astronomical in some cases. So think about those things before you get too excited about smart cars, okay?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Answer</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The reading passage and lecture both discuss aspects of smart cars. However, the professor states that smart cars will not be as great as people expect. She gives two reasons why she believes they will not improve on current vehicles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, the professor asserts that smart cars will not resemble scenes in movies where they move rapidly through cities. She states that, as automobile technology has improved, it has always created more traffic, not less. This contradicts the reading passage, which affirms that smart cars will avoid traffic jams by controlling the routes they drive along. Also, the lecture claims that future traffic jams involving smart cars will be bigger than they currently are.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next lecturer mentions the maintenance costs of smart cars. She declares that most smart car parts are custom-made, so they must be specially manufactured, making them incredibly expensive. The reading, however, states that smart cars will tell their owners when they have minor problems, allowing them to be fixed rather cheaply. However, the professor states that, while labor fees will not be expensive, any repair work involving spare parts will be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, the professor has a dim view of the future of smart  cars, which directly contrasts the opinion of the author of the reading passage, who believes smart cars will be very beneficial.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1 Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use spedific reasons and details to explain your answer?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Personally, I think studying abroad is a very expensive choice. I believe that a person should have well defined purposes that have taken into account the total cost of foreign study vs. The probable benefits of having such an education. Unless the person has money to burn, the benefits must outweigh the costs. In my opinion, there are three common situations that prompt a student to study abroad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first situation involves students who cannot gain addmission to a reputable university in their home country. A typical example is a student who has not done well on his college entrance examinations. It must be very disappointing when a student finds out that he has been effectively excluded from studying in his home country. It would also seem unlikely that such a student would be successful at passing courses taught solely in a foreign language. Nevertheless, people who study abroad out of necessity are probably more motivated to succeed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second situation involves people who want to pursue a course of study that is not available in their home country. For example, a college graduate with a major in accounting might want to obtain a master’s degree in a country where western accounting standards are taught and used. Some students simply desire a higher level of quality that is not available in their home country. Others hope that a degree from a foreign university will earn them a higher salary in their home country.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third situation concerns students who are majoring in English or who have a strong desire to learn English in addition to their major. These students study abroad so that they can live and be taught in an English-speaking environment. They have probably discovered that it is nearly impossible to master a second language any other way. So these students benefit the most from studying abroad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, I think there are many reasons for studying abroad, some good, some not so good, For a number of people, it’s the only way to attend a reputable university or purse an advanced course of study in their field. For others, it is the best way to master a foreign language.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Why go to university?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>University is no longer a fresh word to people nowadays.Since the beginning of this century, more and more youngsters choose to enter university after they have completed the study in high schools rather than to join the army or become an <strong>apprentice</strong>. Therefore, it is kind of interesting to find out the reason behind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, students can only learn fundamental knowledge during high school while they are able to focus on their own interested majors in universities. This period is the key to knowledge accumulation, which will contribute a lot to the future of an individual. Moreover, university is no doubt the symbol of high education. It offers more than pure knowledge. A degree from a university gives people certain identity that makes them stand out among their competitors. It can be seen from the fact that most international companies will only hire those who have at least a Bachelor’s degree.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sincere dreams might also be the reason for university or college. For instance, in the 60s and 70s, people in China experienced hard times. Many of them had to give up advanced education and take up the burdens of life at their early age. Now, as they became parents or even grandparents, their dream for university education had no doubt realized by their younger family members. Those young people, as reported, often study very hard in order to fulfill the expectations of two generations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that university can be the turning point of one’s future, because higher education will provide people with not only knowledge prepared for their careers, but also the fulfillment of their life goals. Meanwhile, the society has improved its strength to sponsor higher education. Compared with the past, people now attend universities also because they are able to secure various scholarships and supports from different channels. A very good example is that many Chinese students are now studying in the U. S. Their incentive for application should be attributed to not only to their own performance but also the comprehensive education frameworks in the U. S.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, people who study in universities have their hopes: to fulfill themselves. At the same time, our society generously provides such an environment for people to achieve such goals. Therefore, when we see more and more fresh smiles on the campus of universities, let us just wish them a promising future.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>People have different views about how much choice students should have with regard to what they can study at university. While some argue that it would be better for students to be forced into certain key subject areas, I believe that everyone should be able to study the course of their choice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are various reasons why people believe that universities should only offer subjects that will be useful in the future. They may assert that university courses like medicine, engineering and information technology are more likely to be beneficial than certain art degrees. From a personal perspective, it can be argued that these courses provide more job opportunities, career progression, better salaries, and therefore an improved quality of life for students who take them. On the societal level, by forcing people to choose particular university subjects, governments can ensure that any knowledge and skill gaps in the economy are covered. Finally, a focus on technology in higher education could lead to new inventions, economic growth, and greater future prosperity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of these arguments, I believe that university students should be free to choose their preferred areas of study. In my opinion, society will benefit more if our students are passionate about what they are learning. Besides, nobody can really predict which areas of knowledge will be most useful to society in the future, and it may be that employers begin to value creative thinking skills above practical or technical skills. If this were the case, perhaps we would need more students of art, history and philosophy than of science or technology.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, although it might seem sensible for universities to focus only on the most useful subjects, I personally prefer the current system in which people have the right to study whatever they like.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Topic sentence - only study useful subjects, various reasons</li>
      <li>Give examples of subjects that are more useful than others</li>
      <li>Personal reasons - job opportunities, career progression, high salary</li>
      <li>Societal reasons - cover gaps in knowledge / skills in the economy</li>
      <li>Future reason - new inventions lead to growth and future prosperity</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later, and it is often argued that these are the best people to talk to teenagers about the dangers of committing a crime.To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that ex-prisoners can become normal, productive members of society. I completely agree with the idea that allowing such people to speak to teenagers about their experiences is the best way to discourage them from breaking the law.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, teenagers are more likely to accept advice from someone who can speak from experience. Reformed offenders can tell young people about how they became involved in crime, the dangers of a criminal lifestyle, and what life in prison is really like. They can also dispel any ideas that teenagers may have about criminals leading glamorous lives. While adolescents are often indifferent to the guidance given by older people, I imagine that most of them would be extremely keen to hear the stories of an ex-offender. The vivid and perhaps shocking nature of these stories is likely to have a powerful impact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The alternatives to using reformed criminals to educate teenagers about crime would be much less effective. One option would be for police officers to visit schools and talk to young people. This could be useful in terms of informing teens about what happens to lawbreakers when they are caught, but young people are often reluctant to take advice from figures of authority. A second option would be for school teachers to speak to their students about crime, but I doubt that students would see teachers as credible sources of information about this topic. Finally, educational films might be informative, but there would be no opportunity for young people to interact and ask questions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, I fully support the view that people who have turned their lives around after serving a prison sentence could help to deter teenagers from committing crimes.</p>

    <p>productive members of society
  discourage them from breaking the law

<blockquote>
  <p>Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Some people believe that parents of children who attend private schools should not need to contribute to state schools through taxes. Personally, I completely disagree with this view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a variety of reasons, it would be wrong to reduce taxes for families who pay for private education. Firstly, it would be difficult to calculate the correct amount of tax reduction for these families, and staff would be required to manage this complex process. Secondly, we all pay a certain amount of tax for public services that we may not use. For example, most people are fortunate enough not to have to call the police or fire brigade at any time in their lives, but they would not expect a tax reduction for this. Finally, if wealthy families were given a tax discount for sending their children to private schools, we might have a situation where poorer people pay higher taxes than the rich.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, we should all be happy to pay our share of the money that supports public schools. It is beneficial for all members of society to have a high quality education system with equal opportunities for all young people. This will result in a well-educated workforce, and in turn a more productive and prosperous nation. Parents of children in private schools may also see the advantages of this in their own lives. For example, a company owner will need well qualified and competent staff, and a well-funded education system can provide such employees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, I do not believe that any financial concessions should be made for people who choose private education.</p>
  </li>
