# 1 Climate Change Essay

> Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

- Climate change represents a major threat to life on Earth, but some people argue that we need to accept it rather than try to stop it. I completely disagree with this opinion, because I believe that we still have time to tackle this issue and reduce the human impact on the Earth's climate.

- There are various measures that governments and individuals could take to prevent, or at least mitigate, climate change. Governments could introduce laws to limit the carbon dioxide emissions that lead to global warming. They could impose “green taxes” on drivers, airline companies and other polluters, and they could invest in renewable energy production from solar, wind or water power. As individuals, we should also try to limit our contribution to climate change, by becoming more energy efficient, by flying less, and by using bicycles and public transport. Furthermore, the public can affect the actions of governments by voting for politicians who propose to tackle climate change, rather than for those who would prefer to ignore it.

- If instead of taking the above measures we simply try to live with climate change, I believe that the consequences will be disastrous. To give just one example, I am not optimistic that we would be able to cope with even a small rise in sea levels. Millions of people would be displaced by flooding, particularly in countries that do not have the means to safeguard low-lying areas. These people would lose their homes and their jobs, and they would be forced to migrate to nearby cities or perhaps to other countries. The potential for human suffering would be huge, and it is likely that we would see outbreaks of disease and famine, as well as increased homelessness and poverty.

- In conclusion, it is clear to me that we must address the problem of climate change, and I disagree with those who argue that we can find ways to live with it.

# 2 Science & Gov

> Many people believe that scientific research should be carried out and controlled by the governments  rather than private companies. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?

- There is no doubt that scientific research can provide a lot of wealth to a country. However, many people don’t know what scientific research is and how it’s actually done. it is a matter of debate whether these researches should be carried out or managerd by governments or private companies. From my point of view, both the governments and private companies should be actively involved in scientific rearches.

- One of the main functions of governments is to do needful things that don't necessarily pay off in the short term. There are a lot of things that are good for society but do not yet and might not ever be profitable for anyone. Good examples are looking for ways to predict earthquakes, the environmental research done from the International Space Station, and research into new surgical techniques. Another typical case is the advent of Computers. IBM did not want to get into computers because it was obvious there was no market.  That's been quoted as an example of a unwise decision, however this is based on the best market assessments available at the time. With massive miltary demands for computing equipment, IBM eventually brought to market a keystone product, IBM 701, in 1952, which lay the foundation for a new era of internet innovation and development.

- People largely think that scientific research comprises of projects like the Manhattan Project and the Apollo Program. While these were clearly the keystone projects that were lead by the government, they largely forget the huge amount of most research has been done outside of the control of government and government funded research. For most of human existence, Scientific heroes in history like Galileo and Leonardo da Vinci were sponsored by wealthy benefactors. If you ask people where they think the technologies that power their iPhone come from, they would never know technologies which are behind the successful product, like the Optical Fiber and LCD Monitors (Corning), Nylon and Teflon (DuPont), the Scanning Tunneling Microscope and the Hard Disk Drives (HDD) (IBM), the C (programming language) and the Transistors (Bell Labs), the Turbo Jet Engines and synthetic diamonds (GE). All these technologies has greatly promoted the development of human civilization.

- In conclusion, Government should support those researches which are extremely valuable but there is no way to make profit in the short term or forever. Also we need to know that the scope of scientific research is wide, therefore private companies continue to play an important role in scientific researches. I do agree both the governments and private companies should be actively involved in scientific researches.

# 3 Personality: ambition

> Do you think how important it is for people to want success in life ? Is ambition a  positive or negative characteristic?

- Characteristic of human is negative and positive. One of the human characteristic is ambition. Everybody must have an ambition to change his life. By an ambition, they can be encouraging themselves to do anything with good result. There are positive and negative from ambition. While there are opinion ambition is a negative thing, there is also a good reason why it might benefit for ambition.

- An ambition can be negative when someone wants to have very deep pretension but it is not comparable with potential in selves. Therefore, he will impose any ways to get anything that he wants. An ambition from negative angle is an ambitious. For example, they want to be legislative candidates, they do not have many supporters, but they do not want to strive and hard work to get support, with the result that they use money politics. An ambitious person is always confident. He always convinced with his abilities. So, he tends to regard the underestimated the ability of others. Generally, people become ambitious just to prove themselves that they can achieve a success. However, they always use wrong way and do anything to get it.

- On the other hand, Everybody has an ambition in selves, which is good thing. Firstly, the true meaning of ambition is power boost. An ambition is a source of inspiration and motivation. It makes people survive and keeping their expectation for the purpose. For the future, that makes a person want to be strong. For instance, a leader must have an ambition and great vision for everyone who is at hand. An ambition could be the positive nature of a good leader. A good leadership needs ambition to have passion for getting a success. Secondly, Knowledge is power, and it is a tool in achieving ambitions. The ambition without knowledge is like ship at sea that dried up. The entire effort will useless, if do not have enough knowledge which should be foundation for anyone trying to reach success.

- In conclusion, there are convincing statements for ambition is a negative thing, but ambitions can also might be beneficial for ourselves. Ambition in selves indeed is good, as long as that can be control with either.

# 3 Personality: ambition

> Do you think how important it is for people to want success in life ? Is ambition a  positive or negative characteristic?

- Ambition is the strong desire to do or achieve something. When people have great ambition, they try their best and put their heart and soul to achieve their goals. However, a highly ambitious people used to be described as a day dreamer or an  unrealistic person. In my opinion, an ambition could be positive and negative for a person who want to be successful.


- There are several reasons why having an ambition could be good thing. Firstly the true meaning of ambition is power boost. An ambition is a source of inspiration and motivation. It makes people survive and keeping their expectation for the purpose. And our work and life have meaning when we feel what we are doing creates worth and is in alignment with what we have. Furthermore, we would not be able to achieve our full potential unless we have ambitions. An ambition man thinks high of himself and hence achieve great things in his life. Last but not least, An ambitious person not only helps himself by achieving great things for himself, but he also help the world by raising the bar for others.For instance, a leader must have an ambition and great vision for everyone who is at hand. An ambition could be the positive nature of a good leader. A good leadership needs ambition to have passion for getting a success.

- On the other hand, an ambition can be negative when someone wants to have very deep pretension but it is not comparable with his potential. If people try to pressure themselves to achieve unrealistic goals, they may not be able to achieve them with the time, talent, and resources they have. An ambition from negative angle is an ambitious. For example, they want to be legislative candidates, they do not have many supporters, but they do not want to strive and hard work to get support, with the result that they use money politics. Also, an ambitious person is always confident. He always convinced with his abilities. Thus, he tends to regard the underestimated the ability of others. Generally, people become ambitious just to prove themselves that they can achieve a success. However, they always use wrong way and do anything to get it.  What is worse, for those perfectionists who believe in the thinking that an achievement is either perfect or useless, they tend to be harsh critics of  themselves when they fail to meet their standards. they run the risk of winding up with an incomplete project and a disappointed audience. as a result, those people inevitably set themselves up for disappointment and are getting farther and farther away from success.

- In conclusion, there are convincing statements for ambition is a negative thing, but ambitions can also might be beneficial for ourselves. For those without ambitions, their life is like making train move without track. they have have no life direction. Dreams or ambitions what drives human beings. When we have great ambition, we try our best and put our heart and soul to achieve our goal. Even when we fail to fulfill our ambitions completely, it is also a success to achieve better things in our life due to our ambition.

# 4 Money-making attractions

 > Some people think that cultural traditions will be destroyed if they are used as money-making attractions aimed at tourists. Others, however, believe that is the only way to save these traditions. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

			There are 3 questions that must be addressed:

			1. How do the money making attractions aimed at tourists damage culture and traditions?
			2. How do they help in protecting culture and traditions?
			3. What is your own opinion on the issue?

It is irrefutable that cultural traditions attract tourists from all over the world and develop local economy. Some individuals are of the opinion that these may be destroyed if they are modified to attract tourists. Others, however, hold the view that if we don’t use them for tourism, they will die. In the following paragraphs, I shall discuss both sides of the argument.

We have to make these cultural traditions alluring for tourists because we need tourists. Firstly, tourism boosts our economy and secondly we get a chance to spread our culture to different countries. If our artists and artisans do not earn money from their art, which depicts our culture and tradition, then this art will die off and we’ll only be the losers.

Tourism is the backbone of any country’s economy and every country does their effort to attract tourists. Many people depend on tourism for their livelihood. People in the food industry, hotel industry and transport industry depend on tourism. Presentation is very important to attract visitors and to present nicely, some change is inevitable.

On the other hand, when cultural traditions are used as money-making attractions, they lose their original features. Sometimes it makes cultural traditions disappear altogether. However, I believe that culture and tradition are deep rooted and minor superficial changes cannot harm them in any way. Change is the law of nature and all we should look into is that the changes are made with caution to retain the inherent elements of culture.

In conclusion, I believe that, to save cultural traditions we need to make some changes to make them alluring to the tourist of today. If we don’t do so we’ll lose our cultural traditions altogether and we’ll lose our tourists also.

# 4 Money-making attractions

 > Some people think that cultural traditions will be destroyed if they are used as money-making attractions aimed at tourists. Others, however, believe that is the only way to save these traditions. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

 - It is irrefutable that cultural traditions attract tourists from all over the world and develop local economy. Some individuals are of the opinion that these may be destroyed if they are modified to attract tourists. Others, however, hold the view that if we don’t use them for tourism, they will die. In the following paragraphs, I shall discuss both sides of the argument.

- On the one hand, when cultural traditions are used as money-making attractions, they lose their unique cultural traditions. Generally speaking, when tourists visit different places, they often desire to experience exotic cultures. In real life, it is not uncommon that the people perform certain rituals or ceremonies for making money, and these people are often looked at as performers. Many local communities are devoted to make profits and losing their cultural identity in such way. Ironically,visitors often look for some similarities in the way of life which they are used to in their own country. Locals to attract tourists adjusting with their customs to make the host more comfortable for visitors. which in turn has a negative effect on the culture being followed or the act being conducted as part of culture.

 - On the other hand, it is necessary to make these cultural traditions alluring for tourists because we need tourists. In effect, tourism boosts our economy and, in turn, promote local culture. Some traditional craft items and dances are recreated and revived by tourism. For example, there several ceramics making villages near Shanghai, China. Jingdezhen is one of the most famous ones among them. Although their products are fine, it cannot compete with cheaper, more colourful and diversity of manufactured products. Nowadays, people in the village open the ceramic making tours.  It offers tourists the chance to create their own items. In this situation, money from tourists help a traditions craft village survive. It’s win-win situation for both tourism and host community. However, if our artists and artisans do not earn money from their art, which depicts our culture and tradition, then this art may die off.

- In conclusion,  A culture or community will alter their behaviours to meet the needs of tourists. Although tourism may exert an negative effect on cultural traditions, I still consider tourists are significantly important for local cultural protection and inheritance, and local communities can keep the ideal balance between tourism and local unique culture.

# 5 Budget: Art & Public Services 

ref link: [nationalpriority.org](https://www.nationalpriorities.org/)

> Some people think government money spent on supporting artists (such as painters, musicians and poets) is better than that spent on other important things. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

> Do you agree arts like painting and music cannot directly imporve people's quality of life, therefore government should spend money on other things?

> Towns and cities are attractive places. Some people suggest that the government should spend money putting in more works of art like paintings and statues to make them better to live in. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

1 | Should the government take a responsibility on the investment in more artistic works to make urban and town areas better place for living, as some people suggest? Personally, I agree that this assertion is a wise policy for the development of a society, while it fails to consider the practical burden of the government finances.

2 | On one hand, art projects play an essential role in beautifying the environment and enriching people’s lives. For example, artistic masterpieces like architectures, paintings and sculptures with high esthetic values can not only make a city more harmonious, humanistic and graceful, but also bring pleasure, excitement and a good mood to the public. Besides, on spiritual level, art works are an ideal stress reliever. After a day of working hard, city dwellers would be inevitably trapped in fatigue physically and mentally. Therefore, engaging in art activities like symphony performance in a theatre is an excellent means by which employees can keep themselves from being overwhelmed by depression or anxiety, and finally recover the vigor, passion and active attitudes towards the life of tomorrow. What is more, artistic buildings, the icons of a city, are always viewed as tourist attractions, such as Sydney Opera House. In other words, spending on art field is a cost-efficient investment that can stimulate the local tourism industry, thus bringing more jobs and a thriving economy.

3 | On the other hand, many others the government spending should focus on more practical social aspects closely associated with daily requirements of the residents, including education, housing, healthcare, transportation and so forth. As for a government of a city with tight financial budget, if it gives the priority of investment to art works over public services, then a whole community will struggle in massive traffic paralysis, attacks of infectious diseases and more violence and social crimes in streets.

4 | In conclusion, there is a balance the government should to reach between art investment and the budgets on public services. In my view, if tax revenue permits, a reasonable allocation of expenditure on art projects is conducive to the city and individuals


- Modified Sample

1 | As an inseparable division of people's life, art has drawn more and more public attention. some people think the government should give the priority to the investment in art. Personally, I believe that without support from the government, many artists are unable to support themselves and many arts forms will die out, which could be seen as an tragedy for all of us. while I also consider the government yealy proposed buget should tradeoff between the spendings on the arts and the expenditures on practical social aspects closely associated with daily requirements of residents.
2 | One the one hand, art is central life-enhancing pursuits for many people in our life. It brings joy and comfort to almost everybody daily. Thus government should financially support artists, when considering their economic situation and essential roles. many artists in modern society are struggling for suvival. Obviously, most people have the basic knowledge in many aspects of their, yet no many of them can really appreciate works of art. Thus, quite a few artists cannot be recognised, let alone having a regular income. Even some extraordinary artists are afflicted by poverty and cannot feed on their own.  What is worse, there may be a case that government may has no important role to play in supporting arts, based on a political view that government does not do it very well, and that private efforts will always be sufficient. If the government just leave some artists alone without offering any support programs, the death of art may be just around the corner. We will find the attention to traditional arts is on decrease, and young people are zealous in the pursuit of fame and money, showing less and less enthusiasm about pursuing artic careers. 
3 |  On the other hand, many others the government spending should focus on more pratical and important social areas, including unemployment, education, social security, medicare and health, food and agriculture, and so forth. As for governemnt with tight financial budget, if arts are given more investment oveer other public aspects, the whole community is more likely tosuffer many urgent and realistic issues, such as rising crime rate, higher poverty rate, terrorist attacks. In fact, governemnt always give the relative high priority to these areas. For example, The American Mandatory spending on these aspects makes up nearly two-thirds of the total federal budget. Social Security alone comprises more than a third of mandatory spending.  
4 | In conclusion, I believe government should to reach a balance between art investment and the budgets on public services. In my opinion. If tax revenue permit, a reasonable allocation of expenditure on art programs benefit the whole society. After all, a world without art would be much bleaker than a world without the nuclear submarines. 


> Background: The U.S. Treasury divides all federal spending into three groups: mandatory spending, discretionary spending and interest on debt. Mandatory and discretionary spending account for more than ninety percent of all federal spending, and pay for all of the government services and programs on which we rely. Interest on debt, which is a much smaller amount than the other two categories, is the interest the government pays on its accumulated debt, minus interest income received by the government for assets it owns. The pie chart shows federal spending in 2015 broken into these three categories.

# 6 Extreme sports 

> Extreme sports such as sky diving and skiing are very dangerous and should be banned. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?

Section| content
---|---
1 | In recent years, extreme sports have become increasingly popular, and some people argue that governments should prohibit them. I completely disagree with the idea that these sports are too dangerous, and I therefore believe that they should not be banned.

2 | In my opinion, so-called extreme sports are not as dangerous as many people think. All sports involve some element of risk, and there should always be clear regulations and safety procedures to reduce the possibility of accidents. People who take part in extreme sports are usually required to undergo appropriate training so that the dangers are minimised. For example, anyone who wants to try skydiving will need to sign up for lessons with a registered club, and beginners are not allowed to dive solo; they must be accompanied by an experienced professional. Finally, the protective equipment and technology used in sports from motor racing to mountain climbing is constantly improving safety.

3 | While I support regulations and safety measures, I believe that it would be wrong, and almost impossible, to ban extreme sports. In the first place, we should all be free to decide how we spend our leisure time; as long as we understand the risks, I do not believe that politicians should stop us from enjoying ourselves. However, an even stronger argument against such a ban would be the difficulty of enforcing it. Many of the most risky sports, like base jumping or big wave surfing, are practised far away from the reach of any authorities. I cannot imagine the police being called to stop people from parachuting off a mountain face or surfing on an isolated beach.

4 | In conclusion, I would argue that people should be free to enjoy extreme sports as long as they understand the risks and take the appropriate precautions.
