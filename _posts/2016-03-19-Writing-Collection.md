# 1 City Life

>More and more people are migrating to cities in search of a better life, but city life can be extremely difficult. Explain some of the difficulties of living in a city. How can governments make urban life better for everyone?

- Cities are often seen as places of opportunity, but there are also some major drawbacks of living in a large metropolis. In my opinion, governments could do much more to improve city life for the average inhabitant.

- The main problem for anyone who hopes to migrate to a large city is that the cost of living is likely to be much higher than it is in a small town or village. Inhabitants of cities have to pay higher prices for housing, transport, and even food. Another issue is that urban areas tend to suffer from social problems such as high crime and poverty rates in comparison with rural areas. Furthermore, the air quality in cities is often poor, due to pollution from traffic, and the streets and public transport systems are usually overcrowded. As a result, city life can be unhealthy and stressful.

- However, there are various steps that governments could take to tackle these problems. Firstly, they could invest money in the building of affordable or social housing to reduce the cost of living. Secondly, politicians have the power to ban vehicles from city centres and promote the use of cleaner public transport, which would help to reduce both air pollution and traffic congestion. In London, for example, the introduction of a congestion charge for drivers has helped to curb the traffic problem. A third option would be to develop provincial towns and rural areas, by moving industry and jobs to those regions, in order to reduce the pressure on major cities.

- In conclusion, governments could certainly implement a range of measures to enhance the quality of life for all city residents.

# 2 Live alone

>　In some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?

- In recent years it has become far more normal for people to live alone, particularly in large cities in the developed world. In my opinion, this trend could have both positive and negative consequences in equal measure.

- The rise in one-person households can be seen as positive for both personal and broader economic reasons. On an individual level, people who choose to live alone may become more independent and self-reliant than those who live with family members. A young adult who lives alone, for example, will need to learn to cook, clean, pay bills and manage his or her budget, all of which are valuable life skills; an increase in the number of such individuals can certainly be seen as a positive development. From an economic perspective, the trend towards living alone will result in greater demand for housing. This is likely to benefit the construction industry, estate agents and a whole host of other companies that rely on homeowners to buy their products or services.

- However, the personal and economic arguments given above can be considered from the opposite angle. Firstly, rather than the positive feeling of increased independence, people who live alone may experience feelings of loneliness, isolation and worry. They miss out on the emotional support and daily conversation that family or flatmates can provide, and they must bear the weight of all household bills and responsibilities; in this sense, perhaps the trend towards living alone is a negative one. Secondly, from the financial point of view, a rise in demand for housing is likely to push up property prices and rents. While this may benefit some businesses, the general population, including those who live alone, will be faced with rising living costs.

- In conclusion, the increase in one-person households will have both beneficial and detrimental effects on individuals and on the economy.

# 3 Food Safety

> Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The food we ate in the past was healthier than the food we eat today.

- Food safety has been cited amply in recent press accounts. Although people today have more food choices than those in the past, from my perspective, it does not necessaryily mean that the food we eat today is healthier than the food we eat in the past.

- First of all, food industry is increasingly commercialized and businessmen do not really care about the food quality when they are devoted to make profits. What makes it worse is that some mercenary food producers adulterate foods without informing the buyers. For example notorious melamine incident poisoned quite a few innocent children, which made the society bristle with anger.

- In addition, the pace of live has been accelerated, and most people eat fast food for saving time, and this choice is harmful to health in a long run. Especially for the young people who are struggling in big cities full of tension every day, a reasonable breakfast seems a luxury to them. Although having fast food saves their time, over time, the bad eating habits will eventually do harm to their health.

- Last but not least, there is a wide variety of food choice in contemporary world, and people have easy access to high-fat or high-calorie food which results in obesity. Most obviously, many people now are so bewildered by the overwhelming advertisement of food that they cannot tell between the healthy food and the junk food. As a result, many  of them are suffering various health problems due to their intemperance in their diets.

- In conclusion, it is true that the recipe becomes more scientific and healthy today but for the apparent reasons discussed above, the food we eat today is unhealthier than thos we eat in the past.

# 4 Tech make our life simply OR complicated

> Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Technology designed to make our life simply actually makes our life more complicated.

- Along with the rapid boom of innovation, advanced technology has made our life simpler. However, its counterproductive effect which gives us miseries can also not be neglected.

- Firstly, facing the computers everyday has involved many people into great pressure. It is because most of our offices have been largely computerized. Long time staring at the screen and fixed in an eternal position, people have been struck by various diseases such as backaches. To make it worse, a lot of stress is accumulated on a psychological level, which may give rise to mental problems, making us unhappy and sick.

- Secondly, cell phones are reducing the quality of relationship among people. Undoubtedly, the emergence of cell phone has greatly facilitated people's life, whereas the convenience comes with a huge price. It can be explained on two folds. For one thing, the intimacy of face-to-face conversation is replaced by the cold voice in the microphone. For another, when we want to have a discussion of serious issues, using cell phone is always inefficient.

- Finally, the popularization of private cars has caused many urban problems. With more cars on the street comes growing traffic congestion, which is a modern plague in almost every major city. Apart from that, the tail gas of cars has directly led to the serious air pollution. Moreover, the non-restriction of driving cars is becoming an increasingly big challenge to car owners.

- To sum up, as we depend too much on technology to enjoy convenience, our life will be mad more complicated by a lot of stresses and problems related to technology.

 # 5 University Subjects

 > Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

- People have different views about how much choice students should have with regard to what they can study at university. While some argue that it would be better for students to be forced into certain key subject areas, I believe that everyone should be able to study the course of their choice.

- There are various reasons why people believe that universities should only offer subjects that will be useful in the future. They may assert that university courses like medicine, engineering and information technology are more likely to be beneficial than certain art degrees. From a personal perspective, it can be argued that these courses provide more job opportunities, career progression, better salaries, and therefore an improved quality of life for students who take them. On the social level, by forcing people to choose particular university subjects, governments can ensure that any knowledge and skill gaps in the economy are covered. Finally, a focus on technology in higher education could lead to new inventions, economic growth, and greater future prosperity.

- In spite of these arguments, I believe that university students should be free to choose their preferred areas of study. In my opinion, society will benefit more if our students are passionate about what they are learning. Besides, nobody can really predict which areas of knowledge will be most useful to society in the future, and it may be that employers begin to value creative thinking skills above practical or technical skills. If this were the case, perhaps we would need more students of art, history and philosophy than of science or technology.

- In conclusion, although it might seem sensible for universities to focus only on the most useful subjects, I personally prefer the current system in which people have the right to study whatever they like.

# 6 Game

> Some people regard video games as harmless fun, or even as a useful educational tool. Others, however, believe that videos games are having an adverse effect on the people who play them. In your opinion, do the drawbacks of video games outweigh the benefits?

- Many people, and children in particular, enjoy playing computer games. While I accept that these games can sometimes have a positive effect on the user, I believe that they are more likely to have a harmful impact.

- On the one hand, video games can be both entertaining and educational. Users, or gamers, are transported into virtual worlds which are often more exciting and engaging than real-life pastimes. From an educational perspective, these games encourage imagination and creativity, as well as concentration, logical thinking and problem solving, all of which are useful skills outside the gaming context. Furthermore, it has been shown that computer simulation games can improve users’ motor skills and help to prepare them for real-world tasks, such as flying a plane.

- However, I would argue that these benefits are outweighed by the drawbacks. Gaming can be highly addictive because users are constantly given scores, new targets and frequent rewards to keep them playing. Many children now spend hours each day trying to progress through the levels of a game or to get a higher score than their friends. This type of addiction can have effects ranging from lack of sleep to problems at school, when homework is sacrificed for a few more hours on the computer or console. The rise in obesity in recent years has also been linked in part to the sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise that often accompany gaming addiction.

- In conclusion, it seems to me that the potential dangers of video games are more significant than the possible benefits.

# 7 Support art

> Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The government should support artists rather than allow them to support themselves.

- As the inseparable division of people's life, art has drawn more and more public attention. While some people maintain artists should live on their own, I believe without support from the government, many artists are unable to support themselves and give up their artistic careers, which will be a great tragedy for all of us.

- First of all, many artists in modern society are struggling for survival. Obviously, most people have the basic knowledge in many aspects of their life, yet not many of them can really appreciate works of art. Thus, quite a few artists cannot be recognized, let alone having a regular income. Even some extraordinary artists are afflicted by poverty and cannot even feed on their own.

- Moreover, if the government just leaves some artists alone without offering any support programs, the death of art may be just around the corner. It can be expained in two folds. On the one hand, many traditional arts and crafts are dying out because the attention to them is on the decrease. On the other hand, many young people are zealous in the pursuit of fame and money, showing less and less enthusiasm about pursuing artistic careers.

- Last but not least, the thriving of art is of great benefit to the society. One reason to think so is that artists, especially those famous one are conducive to promoting the traditional culture and helping the public raise social responsibility. Besides, many forms of art are part of cultural heritage, if they are well inherited, our human world will be more civilized.

- Taking into account their economic situation and essential roles in the society, the government must financially support artists rather than let them die.

# 8 Luck & Success

> “When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success.” Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.

- Many people claim that success comes only as a result of hard work, while others believe that it is mostly the result of good fortune.  I believe that the former is true; success is only achieved by people who are diligent, hard-working and perseverant.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.

- To begin with, success is not the result of a single lucky strike, but is instead the cumulative result of a lot of hard work.  Success happens over time and only after a series of correct decisions and small victories.  A stroke of luck, in contrast, is generally perceived to be a one-time event.  The experience of my uncle, a successful entrepreneur, is a good example of what I mean.  He runs a very profitable technology firm which manufactures and sells a wide range of products.  His business started very small when he invested his savings to bring to market a single product and hired his first employee.  When his single product found a market, my uncle compounded his success with a series of profitable mergers that increased the size of his company.  His company later grew from a single employee to include a staff of dozens.  While my uncle might have been lucky at one stage of his company’s growth, the long-term success of his firm cannot simply be ascribed to good fortune.

- Secondly, people today tend to misattribute the results of hard work and diligence to simple blind luck. Too many people ascribe to luck things which are actually the result of careful planning, research and “business smarts.”  For example, some people said that my uncle was lucky when his initial product offering was successful.  However, he was confident that his product would be a hit even before he started manufacturing it.  This is because he spent thousands of dollars on market research and focus groups.  It was this investment, not luck, which ensured the early success of his business.  Likewise, when his small firm completed its first merger just before the target company rose to prominence some called him lucky.  In this case, though, my uncle had spent weeks interviewing the research and development team at that company and predicted their success based on what they told him about their planning.  Had he not been confident of their success, he would not have completed the merger.   Again, this victory was the result of diligence rather than luck, despite what some observers say about it.

-  In conclusion, I strongly believe that success comes as a result of hard work, rather than good fortune.  This is because success is a gradual and cumulative process, and because the public’s conception of luck is very superficial and hollow.

# 9 Gov Help 

>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People can solve important problems by themselves or with the help from their family members, so there is no need for the government to help them.

- Solving problems is a necessary part of our daily life, and as we grow older we develop more problem-solving skills. In my opinion, while people can depend on their own or their family members to deal with daily problems, there do exist a few problems that can only be handled by the goverment.

- To begin with, there are an increasing number of environmental problems that are gradually out of everyone's control. That is to say, most people can hardly do anything effective to solve them. However, the government is in a position to pool resources to reduce severe air pollution. And many governments in the world have successfully protected the environment through legislation.

- In addition, public security calls for help from goverment. With growing rates of crime, citizens' sense of safety remains to be improved. Apparently, the government is more powerful to combat various crimes than the individuals. By using greater police force and creating more job opportunities, the government can effectively maintain public order and increase the overall social stability.

- Finally, any problems with medical insurance should be addressed by the government. A sad fact in our modern society is that many people are facing high expenses in medical care. Through restructuring, the government can considerably reduce the cost of healthcare. In other words, it is not the individuals but the government who can fundamentally reform the medical system.

- To conclude, as people and their family members have limited powers to change things, government involvement is an indispensable part in the solutions to many of our environmental, social and medical problems.

# 10 Road Safety

> Some people think that strict punishments for driving offences are the key to reducing traffic accidents. Others, however, believe that other measures would be more effective in improving road safety. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

- People have differing views with regard to the question of how to make our roads safer. In my view, both punishments and a range of other measures can be used together to promote better driving habits.

- On the one hand, strict punishments can certainly help to encourage people to drive more safely. Penalties for dangerous drivers can act as a deterrent, meaning that people avoid repeating the same offence. There are various types of driving penalty, such as small fines, licence suspension, driver awareness courses, and even prison sentences. The aim of these punishments is to show dangerous drivers that their actions have negative consequences. As a result, we would hope that drivers become more disciplined and alert, and that they follow the rules more carefully.

- On the other hand, I believe that safe driving can be promoted in several different ways that do not punish drivers. Firstly, it is vitally important to educate people properly before they start to drive, and this could be done in schools or even as part of an extended or more difficult driving test. Secondly, more attention could be paid to safe road design. For example, signs can be used to warn people, speed bumps and road bends can be added to calm traffic, and speed cameras can help to deter people from driving too quickly. Finally, governments or local councils could reduce road accidents by investing in better public transport, which would mean that fewer people would need to travel by car.

- In conclusion, while punishments can help to prevent bad driving, I believe that other road safety measures should also be introduced.

# 11 Stay Healthy

> People do many different things to stay healthy. What do you do for good health? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

 - Maintaining our health is one of the most effective ways of ensuring that we live a long and happy life.  I do many things in order to stay fit, but the most important maintaining a healthy diet.  There are two reasons why I think this is critically important, which I will explore in the following essay.

- To begin with, eating healthy food prevents obesity, which is the cause of many very serious illnesses.  Obesity is debilitating all by itself, but it also causes patients to suffer from a variety of other illnesses, including diabetes, arthritis and heart disease.  It is important to be aware of this connection when making decisions about the food which we eat.  My eldest cousin is a good example of this.  While my cousin maintained a healthy weight throughout high school and university (despite eating a lot of unhealthy snacks and junk food), when he entered adulthood his metabolism changed and he began to rapidly gain weight.  My cousin is not a particularly self-conscious individual and was never bothered by how his weight gain affected his appearance, so he continued to eat an unhealthy diet.  However, he was eventually diagnosed with adult-onset diabetes which has had a profound effect on his quality of life.  He now regrets not being a bit more careful about his consumption choices.

- Secondly, eating healthy food gives me a lot of energy, which keeps me effective in my personal and professional pursuits.  It is no secret that people who are lacking in certain vitamins and nutrients lack the energy necessary to complete even simple tasks.  I recall how when I was a university student I often skipped meals because I was quite busy studying.  As a result of not eating proper meals, I started to suffer from fatigue and lethargy. My grades began to drop because when it came time to write my tests I could barely keep my eyes open long enough to answer the questions.  Not only that, but my submitted assignments were also quite poor as my fatigue made me unable to keep up with them.  The following year I was a bit more diligent about making healthy food choices and my grades quickly recovered.

- In conclusion, the most important thing I do in order to stay healthy is maintain a nutritious diet.  This is because keeping a healthy diet prevents obesity and related diseases, and because it gives me the energy to keep up with my academic and professional obligations.

# 12 Celebrities

> Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

- It is true that some celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyles rather than for the work they do. While I agree that these celebrities set a bad example for children, I believe that other famous people act as positive role models.

- On the one hand, many people do achieve fame without really working for it. They may have inherited money from parents, married a famous or wealthy person, or they may have appeared in gossip magazines or on a reality TV programme. A good example would be Paris Hilton, who is rich and famous for the wrong reasons. She spends her time attending parties and nightclubs, and her behaviour promotes the idea that appearance, glamour and media profile are more important than hard work and good character. The message to young people is that success can be achieved easily, and that school work is not necessary.

- On the other hand, there are at least as many celebrities whose accomplishments make them excellent role models for young people. Actors, musicians and sports stars become famous idols because they have worked hard and applied themselves to develop real skills and abilities. They demonstrate great effort, determination and ambition, which is required for someone who wants to be truly successful in their chosen field. An example is the actor and martial artist Jackie Chan, who has become world famous through years of practice and hard work. This kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance.

- In conclusion, it seems to me that the influence of celebrities on young people can be positive as well as negative.

# 13 Earth

> Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

- Human activity is causing the world to change at a rapid pace these days. I am of the opinion that humanity has had a mostly negative effect on the planet.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.

- To begin with, industrial development has caused major air pollution, which has a terrible effect on human health.  Every week I hear news reports about how horrible air quality is in major cities all over the world.  At the same time, we often hear that chronic lung diseases are on the rise and that there is connection between these two trends.  I am reminded of the years I spent living in Beijing, China.  After having spent most of my life living in a small town where the air is mostly clean, I immediately noticed the smog and pollution of the big city.  Within months I was suffering from a variety of respiratory illnesses and had difficulty breathing.  I spent quite a few afternoons at a local hospital being treated for various throat and lung infections.  A majority of the population of the Earth now resides in cities and all such people are suffering from the consequences of industrial development.

- Secondly, human development has lead to a massive accumulation of trash, which spoils the natural beauty of this planet.  While in the past products were often made of biodegradable materials like paper and wood, today most manufactured goods are made of plastic, which never breaks down.  Such materials eventually find their way into permanent landfills, but just as often end up as litter.  When I traveled to the island in Hainan last summer I was struck by the beauty of the place, but I also noticed that the natural environment was marred by an accumulation of plastic bags and water bottles that were strewn everywhere, even in otherwise pristine forests and rivers.  Had I visited the island a century ago I would not have found it tainted in such a way.

- In conclusion, I strongly believe that human activity has made the planet a less pleasant place to live.  This is because people are more likely to suffer from the effects of pollution than in the past, and because human waste has destroyed the natural beauty of our world.

# 14 Film

>Many people prefer foreign films, while others are more like to watch locally produced films. Which would your prefer? Should governments give more financial support to local film industries?

- It is true that foreign films are more popular in many countries than domestically produced films. There could be several reasons why this is the case, and I believe that governments should promote local film-making by subsidizing the industry.

- There are various reasons why many people find foreign films more enjoyable than the films produced in their own countries. Firstly, the established film industries in certain countries have huge budgets for action, special effects and to shoot scenes in spectacular locations. Hollywood blockbusters like ‘Avatar’ or the James Bond films are examples of such productions, and their global appeal is undeniable. Another reason why these big-budget films are so successful is that they often star the most famous actors and actresses, and they are made by the most accomplished producers and directors. The poor quality, low-budget filmmaking in many countries suffers in comparison.

- In my view, governments should support local film industries financially. In every country, there may be talented amateur film-makers who just need to be given the opportunity to prove themselves. To compete with big-budget productions from overseas, these people need money to pay for film crews, actors and a host of other costs related to producing high-quality films. If governments did help with these costs, they would see an increase in employment in the film industry, income from film sales, and perhaps even a rise in tourist numbers. New Zealand, for example, has seen an increase in tourism related to the 'Lord of the Rings' films, which were partly funded by government subsidies.

- In conclusion, I believe that increased financial support could help to raise the quality of locally made films and allow them to compete with the foreign productions that currently dominate the market.

# 15 Unpaid Work

> Teenagers should be required to do unpaid work

- Many young people work on a volunteer basis, and this can only be beneficial for both the individual and society as a whole. However, I do not agree that we should therefore force all teenagers to do unpaid work.

- Most young people are already under enough pressure with their studies, without being given the added responsibility of working in their spare time. School is just as demanding as a full-time job, and teachers expect their students to do homework and exam revision on top of attending lessons every day. When young people do have some free time, we should encourage them to enjoy it with their friends or to spend it doing sports and other leisure activities. They have many years of work ahead of them when they finish their studies.

- At the same time, I do not believe that society has anything to gain from obliging young people to do unpaid work. In fact, I would argue that it goes against the values of a free and fair society to force a group of people to do something against their will. Doing this can only lead to resentment amongst young people, who would feel that they were being used, and parents, who would not want to be told how to raise their children. Currently, nobody is forced to volunteer, and this is surely the best system.

- In conclusion, teenagers may choose to work for free and help others, but in my opinion we should not make this compulsory.

#16 Animal experiments 

> Nowadays animal experiments are widely used to develop new medicines and to test the safety of other products. Some people argue that these experiments should be banned because it is morally wrong to cause animals to suffer, while others are in favour of them because of their benefits to humanity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

- It is true that medicines and other products are routinely tested on animals before they are cleared for human use. While I tend towards the viewpoint that animal testing is morally wrong, I would have to support a limited amount of animal experimentation for the development of medicines.

- On the one hand, there are clear ethical arguments against animal experimentation. To use a common example of this practice, laboratory mice may be given an illness so that the effectiveness of a new drug can be measured. Opponents of such research argue that humans have no right to subject animals to this kind of trauma, and that the lives of all creatures should be respected. They believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused, and that scientists should use alternative methods of research.

- On the other hand, reliable alternatives to animal experimentation may not always be available. Supporters of the use of animals in medical research believe that a certain amount of suffering on the part of mice or rats can be justified if human lives are saved. They argue that opponents of such research might feel differently if a member of their own families needed a medical treatment that had been developed through the use of animal experimentation. Personally, I agree with the banning of animal testing for non-medical products, but I feel that it may be a necessary evil where new drugs and medical procedures are concerned.

- In conclusion, it seems to me that it would be wrong to ban testing on animals for vital medical research until equally effective alternatives have been developed.

#17 Music

> There are many different types of music in the world today. Why do we need music? Is the traditional music of a country more important than the international music that is heard everywhere nowadays?

- It is true that a rich variety of musical styles can be found around the world. Music is a vital part of all human cultures for a range of reasons, and I would argue that traditional music is more important than modern, international music.

- Music is something that accompanies all of us throughout our lives. As children, we are taught songs by our parents and teachers as a means of learning language, or simply as a form of enjoyment. Children delight in singing with others, and it would appear that the act of singing in a group creates a connection between participants, regardless of their age. Later in life, people’s musical preferences develop, and we come to see our favourite songs as part of our life stories. Music both expresses and arouses emotions in a way that words alone cannot. In short, it is difficult to imagine life without it.

- In my opinion, traditional music should be valued over the international music that has become so popular. International pop music is often catchy and fun, but it is essentially a commercial product that is marketed and sold by business people. Traditional music, by contrast, expresses the culture, customs and history of a country. Traditional styles, such as ...(example)..., connect us to the past and form part of our cultural identity. It would be a real pity if pop music became so predominant that these national styles disappeared.

- In conclusion, music is a necessary part of human existence, and I believe that traditional music should be given more importance than international music.

#18 Tech

> Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships that people make? Has this been a positive or negative development?

- It is true that new technologies have had an influence on communication between people. Technology has affected relationships in various ways, and in my opinion there are both positive and negative effects.

- Technology has had an impact on relationships in business, education and social life. Firstly, telephones and the Internet allow business people in different countries to interact without ever meeting each other. Secondly, services like Skype create new possibilities for relationships between students and teachers. For example, a student can now take video lessons with a teacher in a different city or country. Finally, many people use social networks, like Facebook, to make new friends and find people who share common interests, and they interact through their computers rather than face to face.

- On the one hand, these developments can be extremely positive. Cooperation between people in different countries was much more difficult when communication was limited to written letters or telegrams. Nowadays, interactions by email, phone or video are almost as good as face-to-face meetings, and many of us benefit from these interactions, either in work or social contexts. On the other hand, the availability of new communication technologies can also have the result of isolating people and discouraging real interaction. For example, many young people choose to make friends online rather than mixing with their peers in the real world, and these ‘virtual’ relationships are a poor substitute for real friendships.

- In conclusion, technology has certainly revolutionised communication between people, but not all of the outcomes of this revolution have been positive.

10|medium|books are not the best medium for communicating news stories||


	Advantages / disadvantages of books:

	The main advantage of books is that they are usually considered to be reliable sources of information. People tend to refer to books when they want to research a subject in depth, and for this reason they continue to play an important role in education. On the other hand, books quickly go out of date, and therefore they are not the best medium for communicating news stories.

	Advantages / disadvantages of radio:

	Radio is a much more effective medium than books for the communication of up-to-date information. We can listen to news broadcasts about events as they happen, and a key benefit of radio is that we can listen to it while doing other activities, such as driving or working. The main drawback of radio, when compared to books or television, is that there is no visual element; we cannot see what the broadcaster is describing.

	Advantages / disadvantages of TV, and my opinion:

	In my opinion, television is the most effective of these three media because it brings us closer to reality than a book or radio programme ever can. For example, we can watch events as they take place on the other side of the world, or we can see the body language of a politician who is being interviewed. The disadvantages of television are that programmes tend to be short and interrupted by advertisements, meaning that information is presented in limited depth.

#19 Language

> Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.

- It is true that some minority languages may disappear in the near future. Although it can be argued that governments could save money by allowing this to happen, I believe that these languages should be protected and preserved.

- There are several reasons why saving minority languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, if a language is only spoken by a small number of people, expensive education programmes will be needed to make sure that more people learn it, and the state will have to pay for facilities, teachers and marketing. This money might be better spent on other public services. Secondly, it would be much cheaper and more efficient for countries to have just one language. Governments could cut all kinds of costs related to communicating with each minority group.

- Despite the above arguments, I believe that governments should try to preserve languages that are less widely spoken. A language is much more than simply a means of communication; it has a vital connection with the cultural identity of the people who speak it. If a language disappears, a whole way of life will disappear with it, and we will lose the rich cultural diversity that makes societies more interesting. By spending money to protect minority languages, governments can also preserve traditions, customs and behaviours that are part of a country’s history.

- In conclusion, it may save money in the short term if we allow minority languages to disappear, but in the long term this would have an extremely negative impact on our cultural heritage.

# 20 Gender & Jobs

> Some people think that men and women have different qualities. Therefore, some certain jobs are suitable for men and some jobs are suitable for women. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

- Women now compete and cooperate with men in almost all walks of life and they have proved their mettle, too. However, men and women are not built alike. They may have the same intellectual capabilities, but physically and emotionally men and women are different and that probably explains why certain jobs are considered suitable for men and certain other jobs suitable for women.

- Until a few decades ago many people used to believe that women are not suitable for a career in science or finance. Such wrong notions no longer exist because many women have proved that they make equally brilliant engineers and number crunchers. Still, certain sectors prefer men over women. There are also some sectors where women outperform men.

- Thanks to their stronger physique, men are more suitable for physically demanding jobs than women. For example, jobs in mining and mechanics are laborious and involve handling heavy machinery. A few women have proved that they are capable of handling such jobs, but the majority of workers employed in these sectors are men. The armed forces also recruit more men than women.

- Though women lack physical prowess, they score better than men in some other areas. For example, women are more caring and patient. These qualities make them become excellent teachers and nurses. Women also possess better people skills and are considered more suitable for careers in hospitality and public relations.

- Of course, several women have proved that they are capable of doing just about anything that men can. Take for instance, the case of Madam Curie, the first woman to win the Nobel Prize for Physics. She proved her mettle at a time when science and technology were largely dominated by men. Women have also conquered the seas, the mountains and the skies. The fact that they lacked muscle power didn’t deter them from pursuing their goals. Still, these are exceptions rather than the rules.

- In conclusion, certain jobs are more suitable for men. There are also certain jobs where women perform better than men. Personally I believe that a person’s physical and intellectual capabilities, rather than gender, should determine his or her career choice. If a woman possesses sufficient physical strength and is determined enough to pursue a career in a male dominated sector, her gender should not come in the way of her goal. The same theory applies to men as well.

# 21 Same culture

> Nowadays the differences between countries are becoming less evident because we see the same TV shows, advertisements, fashion and follow the same brands. To what extent the advantages of this trend outweigh its disadvantages?

- We are now living in a global village where geographical barriers have become insignificant. All over the world, people wear the same kind of clothes, eat the same foods and watch the same films. In my opinion, this trend has made life easier for us all.

- There are several benefits to following global fashion trends. It makes traveling easier. For example, now Indians and Americans or Europeans have more or less the same tastes in fashion, food and music. As a result, young Indian professionals can travel to the US or Europe and still feel at home there.

- The biggest advantage of following a global lifestyle is that it eliminates culture shock when you travel to other countries. It also protects you from discrimination. When you wear the same kind of clothes or eat the same kind of foods as everyone else, you will not stand out. This will actually protect you from various forms of discrimination that you might experience when you are in a foreign country. An Indian woman living in the US will be at a disadvantage if she insists on wearing only traditional Indian clothes and eating only vegetarian foods. This will limit the choices she has, but if she is willing to follow the culture of the country she lives in, life will be easier for her.

- The only disadvantage of this trend is the loss of ethnicity. Every nation has its traditional styles of fashion and clothing. When everyone wears the same kind of clothes, this cultural legacy gets lost.

- To conclude, the benefits of following global trends in lifestyle and fashion are many. It makes life easier for the globetrotting youngsters. There are, nonetheless, a few disadvantages, but there is an easy way to get around them. People who are proud of their ethnic fashion and lifestyle can follow it when they are in their own country.

# 22 Museum: Entaining/Educational

> Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give you own opinion.

- People have different views about the role and function of museums. In my opinion, museums can and should be both entertaining and educational.

- On the one hand, it can be argued that the main role of a museum is to entertain. Museums are tourist attractions, and their aim is to exhibit a collection of interesting objects that many people will want to see. The average visitor may become bored if he or she has to read or listen to too much educational content, so museums often put more of an emphasis on enjoyment rather than learning. This type of museum is designed to be visually spectacular, and may have interactive activities or even games as part of its exhibitions.

- On the other hand, some people argue that museums should focus on education. The aim of any exhibition should be to teach visitors something that they did not previously know. Usually this means that the history behind the museum’s exhibits needs to be explained, and this can be done in various ways. Some museums employ professional guides to talk to their visitors, while other museums offer headsets so that visitors can listen to detailed commentary about the exhibition. In this way, museums can play an important role in teaching people about history, culture, science and many other aspects of life.

- In conclusion, it seems to me that a good museum should be able to offer an interesting, enjoyable and educational experience so that people can have fun and learn something at the same time.

# 23 Computer

> Computer technology has had more of a negative impact than a positive impact on the society? How far do you agree with this statement? Support your views with reasons and/or examples from your own experience.

- Every coin has two sides; computer technology is no different. However, I can’t agree with the argument that its disadvantages outweigh its advantages. Yes, there are some negative aspects, but in my opinion, there are many more positive aspects.

- Computers and the internet have made us more efficient. Today huge amounts of information are available online. If we have a computer and an internet connection we can access the whole of this information from anywhere in the world. The internet has made it possible for us to stay connected to our near and dear ones all the time. It has made it possible for people to work from their home and get paid. Thanks to the internet, we can now learn foreign languages without leaving our country.	

- Computers have increased our efficiency. We can now perform more tasks in less time. Jobs that took weeks or months 20 or 30 years ago can now be done in a matter of hours. Computer technology also allows doctors to diagnose diseases more accurately. It helps us to predict natural calamities and save lives.

- There are some drawbacks as well. People’s privacy often gets violated on the internet. Also, in the recent past there have been several incidents of hacking. Malicious software programs like viruses can infect computers and compromise the personal and financial information of the user. However, in most cases, these problems can be controlled with a little effort. For example, by installing anti-virus programs on their computer, people can protect their computers from malware and spyware.

- To conclude, computers and the internet have improved our lives in many ways. There are some negative impacts as well, but they cannot be a hindrance for the positive development of mankind.

# 24 Businesses & Social Responsibilities

> As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

- Businesses have always sought to make a profit, but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people talk about the social obligations that companies have. I completely agree with the idea that businesses should do more for society than simply make money.

- On the one hand, I accept that businesses must make money in order to survive in a competitive world. It seems logical that the priority of any company should be to cover its running costs, such as employees’ wages and payments for buildings and utilities. On top of these costs, companies also need to invest in improvements and innovations if they wish to remain successful. If a company is unable to pay its bills or meet the changing needs of customers, any concerns about social responsibilities become irrelevant. In other words, a company can only make a positive contribution to society if it is in good financial health.

- On the other hand, companies should not be run with the sole aim of maximising profit; they have a wider role to play in society. One social obligation that owners and managers have is to treat their employees well, rather than exploiting them. For example, they could pay a “living wage” to ensure that workers have a good quality of life. I also like the idea that businesses could use a proportion of their profits to support local charities, environmental projects or education initiatives. Finally, instead of trying to minimise their tax payments by using accounting loopholes, I believe that company bosses should be happy to contribute to society through the tax system.

- In conclusion, I believe that companies should place as much importance on their social responsibilities as they do on their financial objectives.

# 25 Socialize Online

> Nowadays more people prefer to socialize online rather than face to face. Is this a positive or negative development?

- People are glued to their cellphones and tablets. They are constantly updating their status on social networks and checking out the photos and videos uploaded by their virtual friends. In fact, most of us now have more friends online than in the real world. In my opinion, this is a negative development that can have far reaching consequences.

- Excessive online socialization can lead to depression, isolation and behavioural problems. The internet is a great platform to share views and opinions, but it also fuels unhealthy competition among people. Studies have shown that people develop an inferiority complex when their friends get more comments or likes than them.

- Social media has many negative sides. There is no guarantee that the people we meet online are actually real. Many of them create fake profiles with the objective of cheating naïve users. There have been several instances of teenagers committing suicide after they got cheated by their online friends. Most people who are addicted to online socialization have hardly any time for talking to their family members or neighbours. This affects family relationships. Also, it can cause the individual to become isolated from his community.

- Face to face communications, on the other hand, lead to the development of trustworthy relationships that last long. Meeting a friend or a dear one over a coffee or in a park is always a memorable experience. Social media friendships lack that warmth. Also, we cannot expect our online friends living in another part of the globe to help us when we are in trouble.

- To conclude, it is not hard to see that excessive online socialization is bad. It affects our relationships. It is true that the internet has enriched our lives in many ways, but if we are addicted to it, we will develop many problems. After all, the virtual world cannot replace the real world; neither can virtual friends the real ones.

# 26 GM foods

>For a long time there has been concern about the quality of the food we eat because of additives and contaminants. Recently genetically modified (GM) food has become more common, causing concern. Is this concern justified or not?

- People are getting more and more concerned about the quality of food they eat. The rich and the famous have already switched to organic foods. Such foods are costly and nutritious. Unfortunately, few people can afford them. Those who cannot afford to buy organic foods are also making a conscious effort to choose foods wisely. They refuse to buy foods containing additives and preservatives. Some of them are also against genetically modified foods. They are worried that GM foods might cause diseases like cancer. However, till date, we haven’t got anything to prove that GM foods cause cancer.

- GM foods have been around for over 20 years. Contrary to popular belief these foods have not been linked to cancer or another disease. There have been several studies, but none managed to prove that GM crops cause cancer.

- Organic foods are certainly healthier than GM foods, but their affordability is an issue. Organic foods don’t contain pesticides. Since pesticides are not used, their yield per hectare is low. Because of these reasons organic foods are way beyond the reach of common man. By contrast GM foods are cheaper. GM plants are resistant to droughts, floods and pests. They can be grown using very little water. Also, they can resist pests. They provide better yields and hence prices are low.

- Over the last few decades, there has been a dramatic increase in world population. The world population is expected to reach 8 billion within the next few years. When there is an increase in population, the need for food also increases. In such a scenario, the only practical solution is to grow more GM foods. Unless our scientists find a healthier and cheaper option, GM foods are here to stay.

- To conclude, people have the freedom to decide what they should eat. If they are particularly concerned about GM foods, they don’t have to eat such foods. However, in my opinion, these fears are baseless. Many people simply overlook the major benefits of GM foods and instead focus on their unproven negative effects.

#27 Parents & TV

> Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? To make children do well in school, parents should limit the hours that children spend on watching TV or movies. 

- In contemporary society, watching TV has become a popular leisure activity among school children. However, when asked about whether parents should limit the hours that children spend on it, people meet with a dilemma. According to my personal experiences, I hold the standpoint that watching too much TV or moviews could have adverse influence on children.

- On top of the first, children can be easily misled by the inappropriate contents on TV because of their psychological immaturity. Firstly, children can have convenient access to the violent scenes in some 'Super Hero' Hollywood movies. They have more chances to imitate the behaviours in the movies and to form the bad habit of using violence to deal with problems in their daily lives. Besides, there are also some pornographic plots on television programs, which will definitely leave unhealthy effects on children's growth.

- What's more, spending too much time on watching TV will absolutely account for children's studying time. Those children will be unwilling to do school works. My sister is a case in point. She often spends at leat three hours on watching cartoons and movies per day even before her examinations. She has less time to finish her homework and review the texts. So she finally failed the college entrance examination. THus watching too much TV programs will adversely affect children's studies.

- Finally, students who spend less time on watching TV will have more chances to stay with peers. They can share common interests and brilliant ideas with each other, which will be beneficial to their futures. On the other hand, those who always stay at home and watch TV will feel being isolated and lack the basic communicating skills.

- In conclusion, I should reinforce my viewpoint that parents should limit the time children spend on watching TV or movies.
