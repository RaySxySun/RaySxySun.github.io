# 1 City Life

>More and more people are migrating to cities in search of a better life, but city life can be extremely difficult. Explain some of the difficulties of living in a city. How can governments make urban life better for everyone?

- Cities are often seen as places of opportunity, but there are also some major drawbacks of living in a large metropolis. In my opinion, governments could do much more to improve city life for the average inhabitant.

- The main problem for anyone who hopes to migrate to a large city is that the cost of living is likely to be much higher than it is in a small town or village. Inhabitants of cities have to pay higher prices for housing, transport, and even food. Another issue is that urban areas tend to suffer from social problems such as high crime and poverty rates in comparison with rural areas. Furthermore, the air quality in cities is often poor, due to pollution from traffic, and the streets and public transport systems are usually overcrowded. As a result, city life can be unhealthy and stressful.

- However, there are various steps that governments could take to tackle these problems. Firstly, they could invest money in the building of affordable or social housing to reduce the cost of living. Secondly, politicians have the power to ban vehicles from city centres and promote the use of cleaner public transport, which would help to reduce both air pollution and traffic congestion. In London, for example, the introduction of a congestion charge for drivers has helped to curb the traffic problem. A third option would be to develop provincial towns and rural areas, by moving industry and jobs to those regions, in order to reduce the pressure on major cities.

- In conclusion, governments could certainly implement a range of measures to enhance the quality of life for all city residents.

# 2 Live alone

>　In some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?

- In recent years it has become far more normal for people to live alone, particularly in large cities in the developed world. In my opinion, this trend could have both positive and negative consequences in equal measure.

- The rise in one-person households can be seen as positive for both personal and broader economic reasons. On an individual level, people who choose to live alone may become more independent and self-reliant than those who live with family members. A young adult who lives alone, for example, will need to learn to cook, clean, pay bills and manage his or her budget, all of which are valuable life skills; an increase in the number of such individuals can certainly be seen as a positive development. From an economic perspective, the trend towards living alone will result in greater demand for housing. This is likely to benefit the construction industry, estate agents and a whole host of other companies that rely on homeowners to buy their products or services.

- However, the personal and economic arguments given above can be considered from the opposite angle. Firstly, rather than the positive feeling of increased independence, people who live alone may experience feelings of loneliness, isolation and worry. They miss out on the emotional support and daily conversation that family or flatmates can provide, and they must bear the weight of all household bills and responsibilities; in this sense, perhaps the trend towards living alone is a negative one. Secondly, from the financial point of view, a rise in demand for housing is likely to push up property prices and rents. While this may benefit some businesses, the general population, including those who live alone, will be faced with rising living costs.

- In conclusion, the increase in one-person households will have both beneficial and detrimental effects on individuals and on the economy.

# Food Safety

> Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The food we ate in the past was healthier than the food we eat today.

- Food safety has been cited amply in recent press accounts. Although people today have more food choices than those in the past, from my perspective, it does not necessaryily mean that the food we eat today is healthier than the food we eat in the past.

- First of all, food industry is increasingly commercialized and businessmen do not really care about the food quality when they are devoted to make profits. What makes it worse is that some mercenary food producers adulterate foods without informing the buyers. For example notorious melamine incident poisoned quite a few innocent children, which made the society bristle with anger.

- In addition, the pace of live has been accelerated, and most people eat fast food for saving time, and this choice is harmful to health in a long run. Especially for the young people who are struggling in big cities full of tension every day, a reasonable breakfast seems a luxury to them. Although having fast food saves their time, over time, the bad eating habits will eventually do harm to their health.

- Last but not least, there is a wide variety of food choice in contemporary world, and people have easy access to high-fat or high-calorie food which results in obesity. Most obviously, many people now are so bewildered by the overwhelming advertisement of food that they cannot tell between the healthy food and the junk food. As a result, many  of them are suffering various health problems due to their intemperance in their diets.

- In conclusion, it is true that the recipe becomes more scientific and healthy today but for the apparent reasons discussed above, the food we eat today is unhealthier than thos we eat in the past.

# Tech make our life simply OR complicated

> Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Technology designed to make our life simply actually makes our life more complicated.

- Along with the rapid boom of innovation, advanced technology has made our life simpler. However, its counterproductive effect which gives us miseries can also not be neglected.

- Firstly, facing the computers everyday has involved many people into great pressure. It is because most of our offices have been largely computerized. Long time staring at the screen and fixed in an eternal position, people have been struck by various diseases such as backaches. To make it worse, a lot of stress is accumulated on a psychological level, which may give rise to mental problems, making us unhappy and sick.

- Secondly, cell phones are reducing the quality of relationship among people. Undoubtedly, the emergence of cell phone has greatly facilitated people's life, whereas the convenience comes with a huge price. It can be explained on two folds. For one thing, the intimacy of face-to-face conversation is replaced by the cold voice in the microphone. For another, when we want to have a discussion of serious issues, using cell phone is always inefficient.

- Finally, the popularization of private cars has caused many urban problems. With more cars on the street comes growing traffic congestion, which is a modern plague in almost every major city. Apart from that, the tail gas of cars has directly led to the serious air pollution. Moreover, the non-restriction of driving cars is becoming an increasingly big challenge to car owners.

- To sum up, as we depend too much on technology to enjoy convenience, our life will be mad more complicated by a lot of stresses and problems related to technology.

 #University Subjects

 > Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

- People have different views about how much choice students should have with regard to what they can study at university. While some argue that it would be better for students to be forced into certain key subject areas, I believe that everyone should be able to study the course of their choice.

- There are various reasons why people believe that universities should only offer subjects that will be useful in the future. They may assert that university courses like medicine, engineering and information technology are more likely to be beneficial than certain art degrees. From a personal perspective, it can be argued that these courses provide more job opportunities, career progression, better salaries, and therefore an improved quality of life for students who take them. On the societal level, by forcing people to choose particular university subjects, governments can ensure that any knowledge and skill gaps in the economy are covered. Finally, a focus on technology in higher education could lead to new inventions, economic growth, and greater future prosperity.

- In spite of these arguments, I believe that university students should be free to choose their preferred areas of study. In my opinion, society will benefit more if our students are passionate about what they are learning. Besides, nobody can really predict which areas of knowledge will be most useful to society in the future, and it may be that employers begin to value creative thinking skills above practical or technical skills. If this were the case, perhaps we would need more students of art, history and philosophy than of science or technology.

- In conclusion, although it might seem sensible for universities to focus only on the most useful subjects, I personally prefer the current system in which people have the right to study whatever they like.
