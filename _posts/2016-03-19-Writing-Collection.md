# 1 City Life

>More and more people are migrating to cities in search of a better life, but city life can be extremely difficult. Explain some of the difficulties of living in a city. How can governments make urban life better for everyone?

- Cities are often seen as places of opportunity, but there are also some major drawbacks of living in a large metropolis. In my opinion, governments could do much more to improve city life for the average inhabitant.

- The main problem for anyone who hopes to migrate to a large city is that the cost of living is likely to be much higher than it is in a small town or village. Inhabitants of cities have to pay higher prices for housing, transport, and even food. Another issue is that urban areas tend to suffer from social problems such as high crime and poverty rates in comparison with rural areas. Furthermore, the air quality in cities is often poor, due to pollution from traffic, and the streets and public transport systems are usually overcrowded. As a result, city life can be unhealthy and stressful.

- However, there are various steps that governments could take to tackle these problems. Firstly, they could invest money in the building of affordable or social housing to reduce the cost of living. Secondly, politicians have the power to ban vehicles from city centres and promote the use of cleaner public transport, which would help to reduce both air pollution and traffic congestion. In London, for example, the introduction of a congestion charge for drivers has helped to curb the traffic problem. A third option would be to develop provincial towns and rural areas, by moving industry and jobs to those regions, in order to reduce the pressure on major cities.

- In conclusion, governments could certainly implement a range of measures to enhance the quality of life for all city residents.

# 2 Live alone

>　In some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?

- In recent years it has become far more normal for people to live alone, particularly in large cities in the developed world. In my opinion, this trend could have both positive and negative consequences in equal measure.

- The rise in one-person households can be seen as positive for both personal and broader economic reasons. On an individual level, people who choose to live alone may become more independent and self-reliant than those who live with family members. A young adult who lives alone, for example, will need to learn to cook, clean, pay bills and manage his or her budget, all of which are valuable life skills; an increase in the number of such individuals can certainly be seen as a positive development. From an economic perspective, the trend towards living alone will result in greater demand for housing. This is likely to benefit the construction industry, estate agents and a whole host of other companies that rely on homeowners to buy their products or services.

- However, the personal and economic arguments given above can be considered from the opposite angle. Firstly, rather than the positive feeling of increased independence, people who live alone may experience feelings of loneliness, isolation and worry. They miss out on the emotional support and daily conversation that family or flatmates can provide, and they must bear the weight of all household bills and responsibilities; in this sense, perhaps the trend towards living alone is a negative one. Secondly, from the financial point of view, a rise in demand for housing is likely to push up property prices and rents. While this may benefit some businesses, the general population, including those who live alone, will be faced with rising living costs.

- In conclusion, the increase in one-person households will have both beneficial and detrimental effects on individuals and on the economy.

# Food Safety

> Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The food we ate in the past was healthier than the food we eat today.

- Food safety has been cited amply in recent press accounts. Although people today have more food choices than those in the past, from my perspective, it does not necessaryily mean that the food we eat today is healthier than the food we eat in the past.

- First of all, food industry is increasingly commercialized and businessmen do not really care about the food quality when they are devoted to make profits. What makes it worse is that some mercenary food producers adulterate foods without informing the buyers. For example notorious melamine incident poisoned quite a few innocent children, which made the society bristle with anger.

- In addition, the pace of live has been accelerated, and most people eat fast food for saving time, and this choice is harmful to health in a long run. Especially for the young people who are struggling in big cities full of tension every day, a reasonable breakfast seems a luxury to them. Although having fast food saves their time, over time, the bad eating habits will eventually do harm to their health.

- Last but not least, there is a wide variety of food choice in contemporary world, and people have easy access to high-fat or high-calorie food which results in obesity. Most obviously, many people now are so bewildered by the overwhelming advertisement of food that they cannot tell between the healthy food and the junk food. As a result, many  of them are suffering various health problems due to their intemperance in their diets.

- In conclusion, it is true that the recipe becomes more scientific and healthy today but for the apparent reasons discussed above, the food we eat today is unhealthier than thos we eat in the past.

# Tech make our life simply OR complicated

> Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Technology designed to make our life simply actually makes our life more complicated.

- Along with the rapid boom of innovation, advanced technology has made our life simpler. However, its counterproductive effect which gives us miseries can also not be neglected.

- Firstly, facing the computers everyday has involved many people into great pressure. It is because most of our offices have been largely computerized. Long time staring at the screen and fixed in an eternal position, people have been struck by various diseases such as backaches. To make it worse, a lot of stress is accumulated on a psychological level, which may give rise to mental problems, making us unhappy and sick.

- Secondly, cell phones are reducing the quality of relationship among people. Undoubtedly, the emergence of cell phone has greatly facilitated people's life, whereas the convenience comes with a huge price. It can be explained on two folds. For one thing, the intimacy of face-to-face conversation is replaced by the cold voice in the microphone. For another, when we want to have a discussion of serious issues, using cell phone is always inefficient.

- Finally, the popularization of private cars has caused many urban problems. With more cars on the street comes growing traffic congestion, which is a modern plague in almost every major city. Apart from that, the tail gas of cars has directly led to the serious air pollution. Moreover, the non-restriction of driving cars is becoming an increasingly big challenge to car owners.

- To sum up, as we depend too much on technology to enjoy convenience, our life will be mad more complicated by a lot of stresses and problems related to technology.

 #University Subjects

 > Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

- People have different views about how much choice students should have with regard to what they can study at university. While some argue that it would be better for students to be forced into certain key subject areas, I believe that everyone should be able to study the course of their choice.

- There are various reasons why people believe that universities should only offer subjects that will be useful in the future. They may assert that university courses like medicine, engineering and information technology are more likely to be beneficial than certain art degrees. From a personal perspective, it can be argued that these courses provide more job opportunities, career progression, better salaries, and therefore an improved quality of life for students who take them. On the social level, by forcing people to choose particular university subjects, governments can ensure that any knowledge and skill gaps in the economy are covered. Finally, a focus on technology in higher education could lead to new inventions, economic growth, and greater future prosperity.

- In spite of these arguments, I believe that university students should be free to choose their preferred areas of study. In my opinion, society will benefit more if our students are passionate about what they are learning. Besides, nobody can really predict which areas of knowledge will be most useful to society in the future, and it may be that employers begin to value creative thinking skills above practical or technical skills. If this were the case, perhaps we would need more students of art, history and philosophy than of science or technology.

- In conclusion, although it might seem sensible for universities to focus only on the most useful subjects, I personally prefer the current system in which people have the right to study whatever they like.

# Game

> Some people regard video games as harmless fun, or even as a useful educational tool. Others, however, believe that videos games are having an adverse effect on the people who play them. In your opinion, do the drawbacks of video games outweigh the benefits?

- Many people, and children in particular, enjoy playing computer games. While I accept that these games can sometimes have a positive effect on the user, I believe that they are more likely to have a harmful impact.

- On the one hand, video games can be both entertaining and educational. Users, or gamers, are transported into virtual worlds which are often more exciting and engaging than real-life pastimes. From an educational perspective, these games encourage imagination and creativity, as well as concentration, logical thinking and problem solving, all of which are useful skills outside the gaming context. Furthermore, it has been shown that computer simulation games can improve users’ motor skills and help to prepare them for real-world tasks, such as flying a plane.

- However, I would argue that these benefits are outweighed by the drawbacks. Gaming can be highly addictive because users are constantly given scores, new targets and frequent rewards to keep them playing. Many children now spend hours each day trying to progress through the levels of a game or to get a higher score than their friends. This type of addiction can have effects ranging from lack of sleep to problems at school, when homework is sacrificed for a few more hours on the computer or console. The rise in obesity in recent years has also been linked in part to the sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise that often accompany gaming addiction.

- In conclusion, it seems to me that the potential dangers of video games are more significant than the possible benefits.

# Support art

> Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The government should support artists rather than allow them to support themselves.

- As the inseparable division of people's life, art has drawn more and more public attention. While some people maintain artists should live on their own, I believe without support from the government, many artists are unable to support themselves and give up their artistic careers, which will be a great tragedy for all of us.

- First of all, many artists in modern society are struggling for survival. Obviously, most people have the basic knowledge in many aspects of their life, yet not many of them can really appreciate works of art. Thus, quite a few artists cannot be recognized, let alone having a regular income. Even some extraordinary artists are afflicted by poverty and cannot even feed on their own.

- Moreover, if the government just leaves some artists alone without offering any support programs, the death of art may be just around the corner. It can be expained in two folds. On the one hand, many traditional arts and crafts are dying out because the attention to them is on the decrease. On the other hand, many young people are zealous in the pursuit of fame and money, showing less and less enthusiasm about pursuing artistic careers.

- Last but not least, the thriving of art is of great benefit to the society. One reason to think so is that artists, especially those famous one are conducive to promoting the traditional culture and helping the public raise social responsibility. Besides, many forms of art are part of cultural heritage, if they are well inherited, our human world will be more civilized.

- Taking into account their economic situation and essential roles in the society, the government must financially support artists rather than let them die.

# Luck & Success

> “When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success.” Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your语义组 position.

- Many people claim that success comes only as a result of hard work, while others believe that it is mostly the result of good fortune.  I believe that the former is true; success is only achieved by people who are diligent, hard-working and perseverant.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.

- To begin with, success is not the result of a single lucky strike, but is instead the cumulative result of a lot of hard work.  Success happens over time and only after a series of correct decisions and small victories.  A stroke of luck, in contrast, is generally perceived to be a one-time event.  The experience of my uncle, a successful entrepreneur, is a good example of what I mean.  He runs a very profitable technology firm which manufactures and sells a wide range of products.  His business started very small when he invested his savings to bring to market a single product and hired his first employee.  When his single product found a market, my uncle compounded his success with a series of profitable mergers that increased the size of his company.  His company later grew from a single employee to include a staff of dozens.  While my uncle might have been lucky at one stage of his company’s growth, the long-term success of his firm cannot simply be ascribed to good fortune.

- Secondly, people today tend to misattribute the results of hard work and diligence to simple blind luck. Too many people ascribe to luck things which are actually the result of careful planning, research and “business smarts.”  For example, some people said that my uncle was lucky when his initial product offering was successful.  However, he was confident that his product would be a hit even before he started manufacturing it.  This is because he spent thousands of dollars on market research and focus groups.  It was this investment, not luck, which ensured the early success of his business.  Likewise, when his small firm completed its first merger just before the target company rose to prominence some called him lucky.  In this case, though, my uncle had spent weeks interviewing the research and development team at that company and predicted their success based on what they told him about their planning.  Had he not been confident of their success, he would not have completed the merger.   Again, this victory was the result of diligence rather than luck, despite what some observers say about it.

-  In conclusion, I strongly believe that success comes as a result of hard work, rather than good fortune.  This is because success is a gradual and cumulative process, and because the public’s conception of luck is very superficial and hollow.

# Gov Help 

>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People can solve important problems by themselves or with the help from their family members, so there is no need for the government to help them.

- Solving problems is a necessary part of our daily life, and as we grow older we develop more problem-solving skills. In my opinion, while people can depend on their own or their family members to deal with daily problems, there do exist a few problems that can only be handled by the goverment.

- To begin with, there are an increasing number of environmental problems that are gradually out of everyone's control. That is to say, most people can hardly do anything effective to solve them. However, the government is in a position to pool resources to reduce severe air pollution. And many governments in the world have successfully protected the environment through legislation.

- In addition, public security calls for help from goverment. With growing rates of crime, citizens' sense of safety remains to be improved. Apparently, the government is more powerful to combat various crimes than the individuals. By using greater police force and creating more job opportunities, the government can effectively maintain public order and increase the overall social stability.

- Finally, any problems with medical insurance should be addressed by the government. A sad fact in our modern society is that many people are facing high expenses in medical care. Through restructuring, the government can considerably reduce the cost of healthcare. In other words, it is not the individuals but the government who can fundamentally reform the medical system.

- To conclude, as people and their family members have limited powers to change things, government involvement is an indispensable part in the solutions to many of our environmental, social and medical problems.

# Road Safety

> Some people think that strict punishments for driving offences are the key to reducing traffic accidents. Others, however, believe that other measures would be more effective in improving road safety. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

- People have differing views with regard to the question of how to make our roads safer. In my view, both punishments and a range of other measures can be used together to promote better driving habits.

- On the one hand, strict punishments can certainly help to encourage people to drive more safely. Penalties for dangerous drivers can act as a deterrent, meaning that people avoid repeating the same offence. There are various types of driving penalty, such as small fines, licence suspension, driver awareness courses, and even prison sentences. The aim of these punishments is to show dangerous drivers that their actions have negative consequences. As a result, we would hope that drivers become more disciplined and alert, and that they follow the rules more carefully.

- On the other hand, I believe that safe driving can be promoted in several different ways that do not punish drivers. Firstly, it is vitally important to educate people properly before they start to drive, and this could be done in schools or even as part of an extended or more difficult driving test. Secondly, more attention could be paid to safe road design. For example, signs can be used to warn people, speed bumps and road bends can be added to calm traffic, and speed cameras can help to deter people from driving too quickly. Finally, governments or local councils could reduce road accidents by investing in better public transport, which would mean that fewer people would need to travel by car.

- In conclusion, while punishments can help to prevent bad driving, I believe that other road safety measures should also be introduced.

# Stay Healthy

> People do many different things to stay healthy. What do you do for good health? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

 - Maintaining our health is one of the most effective ways of ensuring that we live a long and happy life.  I do many things in order to stay fit, but the most important maintaining a healthy diet.  There are two reasons why I think this is critically important, which I will explore in the following essay.

- To begin with, eating healthy food prevents obesity, which is the cause of many very serious illnesses.  Obesity is debilitating all by itself, but it also causes patients to suffer from a variety of other illnesses, including diabetes, arthritis and heart disease.  It is important to be aware of this connection when making decisions about the food which we eat.  My eldest cousin is a good example of this.  While my cousin maintained a healthy weight throughout high school and university (despite eating a lot of unhealthy snacks and junk food), when he entered adulthood his metabolism changed and he began to rapidly gain weight.  My cousin is not a particularly self-conscious individual and was never bothered by how his weight gain affected his appearance, so he continued to eat an unhealthy diet.  However, he was eventually diagnosed with adult-onset diabetes which has had a profound effect on his quality of life.  He now regrets not being a bit more careful about his consumption choices.

- Secondly, eating healthy food gives me a lot of energy, which keeps me effective in my personal and professional pursuits.  It is no secret that people who are lacking in certain vitamins and nutrients lack the energy necessary to complete even simple tasks.  I recall how when I was a university student I often skipped meals because I was quite busy studying.  As a result of not eating proper meals, I started to suffer from fatigue and lethargy. My grades began to drop because when it came time to write my tests I could barely keep my eyes open long enough to answer the questions.  Not only that, but my submitted assignments were also quite poor as my fatigue made me unable to keep up with them.  The following year I was a bit more diligent about making healthy food choices and my grades quickly recovered.

- In conclusion, the most important thing I do in order to stay healthy is maintain a nutritious diet.  This is because keeping a healthy diet prevents obesity and related diseases, and because it gives me the energy to keep up with my academic and professional obligations.
