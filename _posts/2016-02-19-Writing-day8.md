# Day 7: Personal Choice & Decision & Influence


# **TASK I: Integrated Writing**

> Sample 1:


> Answer

- The lecture opposes the view mentioned in the reading with strong supporting evidences presented, aiming to further prove that Wilhelm Naundorff was not the lost prince of France.
- Firstly, from the perspective of his comprehension of the royal routines, the professor states his doubt, because according to the lecture, the daily habits could be learned from history materials and he was bad in France, which indicates he could not have been the prince of France.
- Moreover, judging from his behavioural similarity to the prince, the professor holds a different view, as the lecture further illustrates that he had kept writing to sister of the prince but she refused to meet him. And also, the sister had seen his picture and found little similarity in his appearance to the lost prince.
- Last but not least, on the point of the arsenic content in his remains, the professor never fails to express his concern, because in terms of listening, the arsenic content may have been absorbed from the coffin after his death. If he had indeed been killed by arsenic, there should be higher level of arsenic content remaining in the bone.

- Reading 说 Wilhelm Naundorff 是法国 lost 的 prince。
- 原因一。 这个人深知王子早年的生活习惯和王室的利益和习惯还有家庭情况。
- 原因二, 王室早期的仆人们都觉得他的行为举止很想当年的王子。
- 原因三,王子被认为是 arsenic 毒死的,在 Naundorff 骸骨的骨头里发现了砷。
- 但是 lecture 的 professor 认为,他不是王子。首先,王子的习惯法国的历史都是可以经过研究学习的,而且这个人的法语很烂。其次,这个人一直给真王子的姐姐写信,姐姐都不见他,而且,姐姐看过照片都认不出这个人是王子。最后,教授认为 arsenic 在 naundorff 身上的微量砷可能是吸收了棺木里的,如果真的是被毒死的应该 在骨头里的砷含量应该很高。所以教授认为reading 不可信。

- The lecture disagrees with the view mentioned in the reading with strong supporting evidences presented, aiming to further propose the measure to tax on gas.
- Firstly, from the perspective of economics, the professor states his doubt, because according to the lecture, the current price of gas is not adjusted enough to indicate the cost. For example, the cost of road maintenance and environment restoration has not been taken into account yet.
- Moreover, judging from the fairness, the professor hold a different view, as the lecture further illustrates that it is possible to descrease the tax of income over the poor to cover their loss in the form of tax on gas.
- Last but not least, on the point of competitiveness, the professor never fails to express his concern, because in terms of listening, as long as the price of gas increases, there will be a decline in the demand of vehicles. In order to survive the competition, car manufacturers have to renovate their products and it thus improves the competitiveness of the industry as a whole.

- 综合写作: 讲 tax on gas, 为了减少碳排放污染.
- 阅读部分三点反对这种税款
- 1 错误经济. 价格应该准确反映成本, 而不是为这种东西收钱
- 2 不公平. 穷人富人都交一样的税, 穷人比较吃亏
- 3 更好的措施, 要求美国车厂生产无污染的车, 这样还可以增加国际竞争力.

- 听力部分三点完美对应:
- 1 正确经济. 现在的价格不能准确反映成本, 比如汽车撞坏了路会要求修路, 还有治理环境污染都需要成本。
- 2 公平. 可以依靠减少穷人的收入所得税来弥补他们被征走的汽油税。
- 3 税同样可以增加竞争力. 由于价格提高了, 人们需求减少, 市场竞争就变得激烈, 车厂不得不改进车辆质量, 于是整体竞争力提高

>Sample 3:

> Answer

- The lecture objects to the view mentioned in the reading with strong supporting evidences presented, aiming to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the device to collect water in desert.
- Firstly, from the perspective of the cost, the professor states his doubt, because according to the lecture, considering that the device can be repeatedly used for 20 times, the current price is reasonable enough.
- Moreover, judging from the willingness to set up the device, the professor holds a different view, as the lecture further illustrates that the device benefits the locals in two ways. On one hand, the water collected in the device can be used to water the vegetables and on the other hand, the trees after growing up can be logged. And thus the locals are willing to do so.
- Last but not least, on the point of the survival of vegetation, the professor never fails to express his concern, because in terms of the listening, once the tree reaches water sources and takes root in the deeper soil, over 90% of the trees can grow well independently without the help of device.


- 沙漠化植被的保护措施,小盒子是否能起到用处。文章说起不到用处,三个原因
- 1 太贵;
- 2 当地人不愿意帮助安装和维护;
- 3 植被成长了脱离了小盒子还是无法生长。

- 听力材料反驳:
- 1 循环使用,可以用 20 次;
- 2 可以给当地人收集水给蔬菜,树长大了可以给当地人提供木材;
- 3 小时候建立了根,长大了不怕恶劣环境

# **TASK II: Independent Writing**

> The older generations tend to have very traditional ideas about how people should live, think and behave. However, some people believe that these ideas are not helpful in preparing younger generations for modern life.
> To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?

- It is true that many older people believe in traditional values that often seem incompatible with the needs of younger people. While I agree that some traditional ideas are outdated, I believe that others are still useful and should not be forgotten.

- On the one hand, many of the ideas that elderly people have about life are becoming less relevant for younger people. In the past, for example, people were advised to learn a profession and find a secure job for life, but today’s workers expect much more variety and diversity from their careers. At the same time, the ‘rules’ around relationships are being eroded as young adults make their own choices about who and when to marry. But perhaps the greatest disparity between the generations can be seen in their attitudes towards gender roles. The traditional roles of men and women, as breadwinners and housewives, are no longer accepted as necessary or appropriate by most younger people.

- On the other hand, some traditional views and values are certainly applicable to the modern world. For example, older generations attach great importance to working hard, doing one’s best, and taking pride in one’s work, and these behaviours can surely benefit young people as they enter today’s competitive job market. Other characteristics that are perhaps seen as traditional are politeness and good manners. In our globalised world, young adults can expect to come into contact with people from a huge variety of backgrounds, and it is more important than ever to treat others with respect. Finally, I believe that young people would lead happier lives if they had a more ‘old-fashioned’ sense of community and neighbourliness.

- In conclusion, although the views of older people may sometimes seem unhelpful in today’s world, we should not dismiss all traditional ideas as irrelevant.
