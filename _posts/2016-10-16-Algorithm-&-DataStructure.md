### Part2: Cue Card

- When & Where this person moved.
	- Well, I once lived with a good friend when I was just graduated from university and rented an apartment with two bedrooms just near where I worked. He was a good guy and got alone well with me since we knew each other in the school. He asked if I would like to live with him so that we could share the rent and I thought it would be perfect to live with him because we were good friends and trusted each other. He moved into the apartment last weekend.

- How you know this person
	- I met him in High School. I spent a LOT of time in class talking to the guy who sat next to me. Obviously, the teachers were not pleased. One day, out of frustration, the teacher asked me to move to the first desk, next to a calm guy. As soon as I sat next to him, the very first thing I noticed was how beautiful his handwriting is. To this day, I think he has the best hand-writing I have seen.Since then we spent years sitting together at school until we switched streams to go to different colleges and later on universities.e solved crosswords, walked/cycled back from school together, spent every holiday at each other's place playing cricket/soccer/computer games, won quiz competitions, played hours of chess and so much more. There is no limit to how much I have learned from him.

- What this person brought?
	- When he moved in, He brought a suitcase which was really heavy and tightly packed, and includes pretty much his stuff from a soap dish, to a fitted bed sheet to a small saucepan. He told me the only thing that he missed was a warm blanket, since he had only brought a very thin one in his carry-on, and it was late November by the time everything arrived.

### Part3

- Do people like to live in big houses or small houses?
	- People may have different views on the question. One the one hand, there are do many compelling reasons why some people feel happier when living in a smaller house. we can list some of them: (1)Easier to maintain. (2) Less time spent cleaning (3)Less expensive (4) Wider market to sell and so on. One the other hand, people may think big houses would be better.(1) owning big house represent people achieve their dream or goal to become successful. Or they just simply need more space with all our kids running around. the true answer depends on what you really want

- Where do old people like to live, city or countryside?
	- In my opinion, many seniors are more likely to seek peace and close to old friends and family, so some of senior may move to the countryside. They are not exactly looking for career growth. Also, most of them have little interest in shopping or partying. However, I can see the reasons why others may choose to live in city. compared with living in the urban areas, those people who live in countryside have to face difficulties in accessing health and social care services due to distance, lack of public transport and services not working together.  Moreover, they are also subjected to higher living costs, housing that can be hard to keep warm.

- Do you like move house frequently.
	-  When I was young, I liked moving. I really didn't have that much stuff; some clothes, a bed, a dresser, and a few odds and ends. I really didn't own much of anything. Moving wasn't that big of a deal. I could have many reasons for moving home.  This could be because there aren’t enough bathrooms, there is no off-road parking, or I was looking for a more modern home with open plan living space. As time has gone by, I have accumulated a lot of stuff. I have even more stuff than I could possibly imagine. I have no idea where some of it came from. Not any more. I hate moving home which is stressful now.

- Is it easy to move house in China?
	- yes, it is quite easy. search proper keywords in WeChat or baidu, you’ll have a whole list of contacts that provide the service. There’re also Apps too. I’ve tried one last year, I would say it’s awesome and quite convenient. Alternatively, if you have a truck or van, you may DIY for sure.

- > 2 Describe a tall building in your hometown you like or dislike 

### Part2: Cue Card

> Sample 1: Describe a tall building in your hometown you like or dislike 

- Where it is
	- I'm going to describe a modern building in Harbin. It's called the Paradise Green Tower, and it's the tallest building in the city, with about 50 floors.
- What it is used for
	- Although it's called the Paradise Green Tower, most people know this building as the Hilton Hotel. In fact, the bottom half of the tower is the hotel and the top half is apartments. The apartments are expensive because the location and views make them very desirable.

- And why you like/dislike it.
	- I'm not sure if I like the design of the building, it's just a huge glass tower, but it definitely stands out. It has become a famous landmark in the city. You can see it as you approach Manchester, and it's an easy place to meet people because it's so distinctive and easy to find. The most interesting thing about the Paradise Green Tower is that there is a bar/restaurant on the 23rd floor which has spectacular views of the city; it's definitely the best vantage point in Manchester because there are no walls, only huge windows, so you can look out over the city in any direction. I'd recommend anyone who visits Manchester to go there and experience the view.

> Sample 2: Describe a tall building in your hometown you like/dislike [link](http://ieltsmaterial.com/ielts-speaking-actual-test-in-september-2016-and-suggested-answers/)

- Where this building is
	- I’m going to describe a high-rise building in my neighborhood. It’s called Paradise Green City, located in xxx.

- What it looks like
	- Unlike other modern blocks, which are usually huge glass towers, the building is painted yellow, although it’s named Green City. The structure of Green City is not dissimilar to that of most buildings in Canada nowadays, with the bottom half used as a shopping center and the top half occupied by apartments.

- What it is used for
	- One feature that makes the building unique is that its trade center offers Canadian products only, with a view to promoting domestic products to xxx people and also to supporting national manufacturers. At the entrance of the building, if you look to the right, you can easily find a store named xxx, which serves traditional xxx to people who just do not have enough time to go inside, so they line up waiting to pay.

- And explain why you like/dislike it
	- (Like) In spite of its prime location, however, Paradise Green City offers a reasonable price for its apartments, which are affordable for many middle-income families. From the building, we can enjoy the breathtaking scenery. So, if you are planning to find a place with a beautiful and peaceful view, or simply want to buy something traditional, Paradise Green City may be a good choice.
	- (Dislike) What I don’t like about Paradise Green City, however, is that its design is neither eye-catching nor original. In fact, I personally find that it resembles Times City, a modern building nearby. Moreover, the paint color doesn’t match its modern structures, which makes the building somehow old-fashioned. And, the quality, as well as diversity of products on sale do not meet the expectations of most customers. So, I guess it’s the reason why the building doesn’t attract as much attention from the public as expected.
